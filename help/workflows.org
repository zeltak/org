#+Title: Workflows

* managing references 
in general its good to work with both the meta file and bib file split when working on managing reference.
open both with the function zrefwork 【\ b w 】

** ADD new PUBLISHED paper (3 steps)
when a new paper is finally published and has a DOI:
1) use the DOI import util from org-ref to add it to my personal bib file:
file:/home/zeltak/org/files/Uni/papers/kloog.papers.bib

2) Make sure to archive it from 'accepted' on the file:/home/zeltak/org/files/Uni/papers/paper.meta.org file.

3) Add to UNI CV and format accordingly

** ADD new UNPUBLISHED paper 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       3d84f260-32a6-43e6-a60d-87c4b0134f4d
   :END:
use the capture template for adding a new working paper 【C-c p p】
it will ask for title and lead author 
it will add it to this file
file:/home/zeltak/org/files/Uni/papers/paper.meta.org
** ADD new ABSTRACT
** ADD papers to read
with org-ref installed you can drag the pdf to you bib file (usually the file:/home/zeltak/org/files/Uni/papers/library.bib) or just add them with the normal DOI/cross ref methods.

once you've added the paper add a tag of rtodo to them

then with helm-bibtex you can generate a helm toread list
** inserting papers to orgmode buffer
use (org-ref-helm-insert-cite-link) which is bound to C-c ] to insert citation(s) via a nice helm GUI
you can also define your specific bib file in the bottom of the buffer like this year
>bibliography:/home/zeltak/org/files/Uni/papers/library.bib,/home/zeltak/org/files/Uni/papers/kloog.papers.bib
* Email
** base email procceses

- delete if it is rubbish
- read and delete if it is not something I’ll need to revisit
- read and archive if it is something I might need to look up again
- reply and archive if it is something that will take less than a couple of minutes to reply to and I have the time
- add to todo list and archive if it is something that requires an action or just needs a longer reply than I have time to write
