#+CAPTION: Average BMI, by country
#+RESULTS: bmi-table-code
**** Code blocks that produce a graph to be included in the document

These code blocks can have a series of commands. The last command produces a graph that we would like to be included in the document.

The following code shows an example of a code block that produces a graph.

#+NAME: mygraph-code
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file bmi2.png :width 825 :height 1050 :fonts serif

#+END_SRC
As before, for creating your graph, you first write the #+NAME, BEGIN_SRC and the END_SRC lines, and then go into a temporary ESS buffer by using C-c ‘.

Once in this temporary ESS buffer, you can write the R commands for making your graph.
As you write, you can evaluate the commands using C-j, C-r and C-b and see what your output looks like.
The output is displayed on your screen using the default graphic device used by R (X11, quartz or windows graphic device depending upon your operating system).
Once you have finalised your graph, you press C-c ’ and come back to the Org buffer.
Note that creation of the image file is left to appropriate switches in the #+BEGIN_SRC line. Org automatically chooses appropriate graphic device to produce the file. When you evaluate this code using C-c C-c, the results are displayed below the code block as follows.

#+RESULTS: mygraph-code
[[bmi2.png]]
Note that, taking the file name from our #+BEGIN_SRC line, a file called bmi2.png was automatically created and linked, so that the graph would be inserted in the document when you produce the formatted output.[fn:5] Every time you evaluate the code using C-c C-c, the underlying image file containing the graph is overwritten by a new file.

As with the tables, we shall add a caption and a name to it as follows

#+NAME: my-bmi-graph
#+CAPTION: Average BMI, by Country
#+RESULTS: mygraph-code
[[gini.png]]
You can now refer to this graph in the text using [[my-bmi-graph]].

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This extension works similar to http://orgmode.org/manual/Speed-keys.html,
;; while adding in a bit of vi flavor.
;;
;; Representing the point with "|", pressing a-z, A-Z, or 0-9 while
;; the text is as below will call a command instead of inserting these
;; characters:
;;
;;   |* foo
;;   *|* bar
;;   |#+ baz
;;
;; As you see, the general theme is beginning of line + org markup.
;; Below, "#+..." will be referred to as markup.
;; Similar to vi, "hjkl" represent the arrow keys:
;;
;; - "j" moves down across headings and markup, but does not switch
;;   between either: use "h"/"l" for that. The exception is the first
;;   markup in the file that does not belong to any heading.
;;
;; - "k" moves up across headings and markup, with same rules as "j".
;;
;; - "h" moves left, i.e. to the parent heading of current thing.
;;   You can use it e.g. to go from fifth level 3 heading to the
;;   parent level 2 heading, or from the second source block to the
;;   parent heading.
;;
;; - "l" moves right (i.e. to the first child of current heading).
;;   You can use it to get to the first markup of current heading.
;;
;; Worf borrows the idea of verbs and nouns from vi: the commands are
;; sentences, combinations of a verb and a noun used together.
;; Verb #1 is "goto", which is implicit and active by default.
;;
;; 5 nouns are available currently:
;; "h" - left
;; "j" - down
;; "k" - up
;; "l" - right
;; "a" - add heading
;; "p" - property
;;
;; Verb #2 is `worf-change-mode', bound to "c". Verbs in worf are
;; sticky: once you press "c", change verb will be active until you
;; switch to a different verb. This is different from vi, where the
;; verb will deactivate itself after the first command.
;;
;; Use the same letter to deactivate a verb as to activate it,
;; i.e. "c" will deactivate `worf-change-mode'.  "q" will universally
;; deactivate any verb and return you to "goto" implicit verb.
;;
;; While `worf-change-mode' is active, "hjkl" move the current heading
;; in appropriate directions: it's the same as holding "M-" and using
;; arrow keys in the default org.
;; "p" will change the selected property.
;;
;; Verb #3 is `worf-change-tree-mode', bound to "cf".  While
;; `worf-change-tree-mode' is active, "hjkl" move the current heading
;; tree in appropriate directions: it's the same as holding "S-M-" and
;; using arrow keys in the default org.
;;
;; Verb #4 is `worf-change-shift-mode', bound to "cs".
;; It make "hjkl" act as "S-" and arrows in default org.
;;
;; Verb #5 is `worf-keyword-mode', bound to "w". You select a keyword
;; e.g. TODO or NEXT and "j"/"k" move just by the selected keyword,
;; skipping all other headings. Additionally "a" will add a new
;; heading with the appropriate keyword, e.g. "wta" will add a new
;; TODO, and "wna" will add a new "NEXT".
;;
;; Verb #6 is `worf-clock-mode', bound to "C". This one isn't sticky
;; and has only two nouns that work with it "i" (in) and "o" (out).
;;
;; Verb #7 is `worf-delete-mode', bound to "d". This one isn't sticky
;; and changes the behavior of "j" to delete down, and "k" to delete
;; up. You can mix in numbers to delete many times, i.e. d3j will
;; delete 3 headings at once.
;; "p" will delete the selected property.
;;
;; Verb #8 is `worf-yank-mode', bound to "y". It's similar to
;; `worf-delete-mode', but will copy the headings into the kill ring
;; instead of deleting.
;;
;; Verb #9 is `worf-mark-mode', bound to "m". It's similar to
;; `worf-delete-mode', but will mark the headings instead.
;;
;; Some other things included in worf, that don't fit into the
;; verb-noun structure, are:
;;
;;  - "o" (`worf-ace-link'): open a link within current heading that's
;;    visible on screen. See https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link for a
;;    package that uses this method in other modes.
;;
;;  - "g" (`worf-goto'): open a `helm' outline of the current buffer.
;;    It's very good when you want to search/navigate to a heading by
;;    word or level. See https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy for a
;;    package that uses this method to navigate Lisp code.
;;
;;  - "L" (`worf-copy-heading-id'): copy the link to current heading
;;    to the kill ring. This may be useful when you want to create a
;;    lot of links.
;;

 punchagan | zeltak: for instance I changed Ammount to AMMOUNT
 punchagan | and it workd.. 
    zeltak | wow ok let me try
    zeltak | holy crap
    zeltak | it worked
    zeltak | so what was it..wow i guess i missed it in the manual
 punchagan | zeltak: and it's a bug.. :)
    zeltak | hehe :)
 punchagan | zeltak: I don't think there is a hard and fast rule specified anywhere in the manual
 punchagan | in face the properties section in the manual has an example .. that doesn't do this
 punchagan | Imagine maintaining a file where you document bugs and plan releases for a piece of software. Instead of using
           | tags like ‘:release_1:’, ‘:release_2:’, you can use a property, say ‘:Release:’, that in different subtrees has |
           | different values, such as ‘1.0’ or ‘2.0’                                                                        |
    zeltak | punchagan: i see
    zeltak | ok good to know its a bug :)
    zeltak | appriciate the help!
    zeltak | can one sparese tree match on 2 properties?
 punchagan | zeltak: no problem! and thanks for the recipes.. I see you have an Indian tag. me checks out.. 
    zeltak | punchagan: your welcome! :)
 punchagan | zeltak: you can do all kinds of stuff with `C-c / m' or `C-c \'. 
 punchagan | zeltak: FAV="y"+Indian+TODO="SHOP"
 punchagan | would work..

kensanata: The only reason I'd like to see namespaces is better compositability. I don't think that's in any of the │
Lisp-based namespace thingies, so not really relevant. Having a de-facto standard for namespace separation vs. word │

zeltak_: you should also consider that you often save files that are half edited.  So you may not really want to    │
systematically have it processed after C-x C-s.                                                                     │

its an app that you need to send a user sig1 to refreash it every time toy edit a config which i find annoying :)   │
If you don't want to get out of emacs to kill, you can write a emacs command to do it: (defun update-sxhkd ()       │

*** dp wrap blocks 
Hi List,

I've written the "eierlegende Wollmilchsau" of wrap-in-block functions
(i.e. the 'all-inclusive mother of all wrap-in-block functions').

To check it out, you need to
jjk 1. Clone or fork the git repo (https://github.com/tj64/org-dp)
 2. (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-dp/") and
 3. (require 'org-dp-lib') in your init file

`org-dp-wrap-in-block' works on/with all kinds of Org blocks, and can be
called interactively or non-interactively.

It

 - inserts a new block when called on an empty line without arguments

 - wraps sexp or region or '+/- X lines from point' into a newly created
   block

 - when called with point inside a block, it either

   + unwraps the blocks content, i.e. deletes the surrounding block or

   + replaces the surrounding block with a different block

It takes full account of affiliated keywords. In case of src-blocks,
it puts src-block parameters on the block's headline, but with
`org-dp-toggle-headers' its easy to toggle between parameters

,----
| #+begin_src R :noweb yes |
`----

and headers

,----
| #+header: :noweb yes |
| #+begin_src R        |
`----

This function takes into account so many options that combinatorics hits
you badly when trying to test all of them. Everything I tried works now
with the current version, but its not unlikely that daily usage will
discover some bugs or untreated corner cases. Please report them with
backtrace.

The good news is that besides its complexity, its not one
mega-convoluted monolithic function for a single task only. Instead I
outfactored the core functionality into the 'org-dp.el' library
("Declarative Programming with Org Elements") which offers potentially
massive time (and headache) savings when programming with Org Elements
on the local level.

'org-dp' acts on the internal representation of Org elements, and due to
the total uniformity of this representation it is possible to do diverse
actions on diverse elements in a very uniform way, thus the 3 functions

 - `org-dp-create'

 - `org-dp-rewire'

 - `org-dp-prompt'

should be all you need for all kinds of programming
tasks. `org-dp-wrap-in-block' is one example of how to program with
org-dp, `org-dp-toggle-headers' is another one.

Hope that this is useful.

PS

For the sake of completeness, here the docstring of
`org-dp-wrap-in-block':

** fix HD res issues
SOLVED (Solution can be found on the bottom)
Hi there I really hope someone can help me...

If got my new XPS13 (2015) yesterday and even though it's a really nice pice of hardware there are some problems (obviously ^^)

So I've got the QHD display (3200x1800) which doesn't quite work with all applications (like google chrome is awfull and isn't affected by the window scaling)

So I thought...
Well lets simpley change the resolution to 1920x1080 for now so I can at least work. Sadly apart from the original 3200x1800 there are only 4:3 ratio resolution (non of them is usable) so I added the 1920x1080 myself using xrandr.
But everytime I set the resolution to use my new one, it sets it, display flickers for a moment and than falls back to the original 3200x1080 (all via command-line). Same happen if I use the UI though.
Next I tried using a custom X11 conf which (it looks like) does set the 1920x1080 while beeing on the lockscreen (I'm using gdm btw) but once I log in, it falls back to the 3200x1800.

Solution
Problem: Changing to the new, manually added, resolution did not work because it immediately switched back to the original one
Solution: (For me at least) removing ~/.config/monitors.xml did the trick. You might have to restart GDM after removing/renaming the file﻿

*** capture via gmail
You could also use a %x in a capture template to assist in capturing a   
selection made on your gmail message.  Eg, select Subject: line, then    
capture that to a TODO.                                                  
The other thing that might help would be custom links. Is there a way to form a URL to a gmail message on the web?  If so, you  
could make a "gmail:XXXXX" link that org would expand to a full URL

*** org sync files
**** sol1
With Dropbox I've had a some "conflicted copy" issues; this is annoying (and is
the sort of thing that would have been solved much more easily with version
control) but happens very rarely. What I like about this is that my frequent
changes in org files get propagated without the need for an explicit version
control command.


However, for safety and for tracking, I run a nightly job with bazaar where I
commit all changes (this is done in only one of the machines, of course). This
has actually proven extremely useful when, by mistake, I have deleted a complete
subtree and only realized maybe a month later.

*** A fantastic font
I've tried several fonts, and all of them were nice, but came up short on some way. Some didn't have italic variants, some had dotted zeroes instead of dashed zeroes, some even had entirely clear zeroes which make them look like O's, others had boring-looking parentheses4. Not Fantasque Sans Mono5, 6, it is awesome. If your web browser supports web fonts you should also see it used in the code blocks here.

For normal Emacs setups you might use the set-frame-font function like so:

*** set a window to open on a specific screen
I believe you are forced to use a method where you place the
windows non-dynamically on the required screen - if you have two
screens both with 1280 width, placing a window at 1280 should put it on
the right screen. (That's not very dynamic, but it could be a start to
work on something at least).

You should be able to get the total screen area (All screens added),
and via that calculate if you have one or two screens attached. Not
much for this kind of thing is implemented in devilspie2 though.

** hack airport wifi

Scan for wireless networks at the airport and you'll probably find a Boingo hotspot. You may already know that you can very easily access some sites without paying. Connect to the network and click the The Good Stuff box. This gives you access to a limited number of complementary sites, but after clicking it, try opening a new tab in your browser and going somewhere else—you might just find it works.

 
Get Free Airport Wi-Fi with a Simple URL Hack
Blogger Felix Geisendorfer points out a clever URL hack that scored him free Wi-Fi at the Atlanta…
Read more
But there's another trick to free airport Wi-Fi. WonderHowTo explains:

Many paywall sites, Boingo or not, simply block the address bar so that you can't freely roam the web. This is great news for you, because you can access a website without an address bar via your web console and inserting window.location.href="https://www.sitename.com" for instant access. Web developer tools are a great way to get around blocked content, and in some cases, they can also help you get around blocked Wi-Fi access.
You'll need to access your browser's developer tools to try this. In Firefox, click the menu button and select Developer > Web Console, or press Ctrl+Shift+K. Click next to the double blue arrow to the bottom left of the screen and type window.location.href="URL of site to visit" and press Enter.

In Chrome, click the menu button and select Tools > Developer tools, or press Ctrl+Shift+I, and then head to the Console section. Use the same syntax to bypass any paywall that may be in place. You may notice that a security warning appears when connecting to sites in this way.

This technique is not guaranteed to work with every hotspot in every airport, but it's definitely worth a try before you shell out for pricey airport Wi-Fi. Click the link below for more information.


Blogger Felix Geisendorfer points out a clever URL hack that scored him free Wi-Fi at the Atlanta airport.
I found that I could easily visit sites like slashdot, Google, or even this weblog, when adding a at the end of the url. The next logical step was to automate that. I downloaded Greasemonkey and wrote a 4 line script that would add ?.jpg to every link in a document. That way I was able to browse most sites without a hassle.
This trick will only work on Wi-Fi networks that allow images to go through without a redirect, and though it may seem like a bit of a stretch, it's better than shelling out $7 for 30 minutes of Wi-Fi. Unfortunately the author didn't make the Greasemonkey script available, but even without it you could get in some decent browsing. The post isn't new, and I haven't tested this, so if you've ever used this trick or you're at an airport or Wi-Fi hotspot and can give it a try, let's hear how it worked for you in the comments

  Gnus can connect to the gmail server in two ways: by POP3, or by IMAP. Each protocol behaves in a different way, so you can select the one which better suits your needs. Furthermore, as a third solution you can download your mail with an external program like fetchmail and let Gnus handle it locally.

  This page describes how to configure Gnus to read and send mails from your gmail account, and should also explain how to do in Gnus what you’re able to do through the web interface.
