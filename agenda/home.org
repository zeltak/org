*Make a $2 Adjustable Smartphone Car Mount in 10 minutes
*ntroMake a $2 Adjustable Smartphone Car Mount in 10 minutes
 Do you ever wander the aisles at store after store looking for just the
right thing to hold your phone/GPS/mobile device while you're driving?
There are tons of these on the market but I've never managed to find one
that worked in my oddly shaped Scion XB. In California you can't mount
anything to the window, and my window is far out of reach anyway. Belkin
makes a charger/mount that goes in the cigarette lighter but that puts
the phone by my knee - definitely unsafe for driving. Giant bean bag
sliding around the top of the dashboard seems like a silly waste of
space. Some "cradles" are ridiculously larger than the device you're
trying to hold. Suction cups pop off at the most inopportune times. And
who wants to put glue or holes in you car?
 Luckily for me, the original (super boxy) XB has an assortment of odd
"spaces" in the dash. These make a perfect place to attach a rock solid,
quick and dirty $2 mount that'll take less than 10 minutes to make from
stuff you likely already have around the house. This mount is adjustable
and easily completely moveable/removable without harming your car in any
way. It can also be adapted to any hold any mobile device that weighs
about one pound or less.
 Note: PLEASE ALWAYS DRIVE SAFELY. My mount works perfectly for me. Your
mileage may vary.
 Do not attempt to use this mount if it in any way impedes your ability
to drive with total concentration on the road or if it's use would be
illegal in your location.
 The way mine is positioned it does not block my view of the road at all
but is right at my fingertips and close enough to the windshield that I
can keep my eyes on the road at all times.
 step 1Locate a Suitable Mounting Location In Your Car
 Go to your car. Take a look at the dash. See if you have any goofy
vacant spaces like mine.
 They should ideally be no at least 1" but no more than 2" tall and at
least that deep. 3-4" wide will suffice.
 Make sure that the spot you choose is well clear of the steering wheel,
vents and any critical controls. We don't want to create a driving
hazard!
 Take some measurements from this spot to where you'd ideally like to
place your mobile device so you'll have an idea what size parts to buy.
I chose the center of the long upper space in the pic.
 If you have no such spaces then I'm afraid this 'ible most likely won't
work for you.
 But if you do, hurray!, read on.
 step 2Tools & Materials
 Materials:
 Get thee to the plumbing section of your hardware store and buy (if you
don't already have):
   1. a 1/2" PVC Tee coupling - make sure that the center opening is
threaded. The other two don't matter.
   2. a 1/2" PVC Street Elbow - it should have male threads at one end
and female threads at the other.
   3. a 1/2" PVC Nipple of whatever length will suit your
car/height/posture. This is basically a tube male threaded at both ends.
They're super cheap, about 50 cents so if you're not sure just get a few
different lengths so you can experiment. I'm 5'9", slouch slightly when
I drive and the 7" nipple is just exactly perfect for me. You'll also be
able to make height adjustments in step 4.
 Test screw all three of these together before you leave the store to
make sure they all have the same threading and fit together! If you care
about aesthetics try to match the interior of your car. Mine is black,
black, black so I chose the black and dark gray parts where available.
You can of course paint the final product or bedeck it with ribbons,
jewels and decoupage if you so wish.
 If you feel like going for a super-heavy-duty-manly look then feel free
to use 3/4" or 1" fittings instead. For a steam punk flair try copper
fittings. Just make sure all the threading matches.
 You will also need:
    4. heavy duty plastic coated wire (I had "multipurpose wire" lying
around, not marked but seems to be about 14-16 gauge)
   5. adhesive backed craft foam - half a sheet or so should do it for a
Scion XB. Use whatever color makes you happy. I happened to have a bit
of red, it looks silly but cost nothing.
 Tools:
   either scissors or an X-acto knife and straight edge
   needlenose pliers with wire cutter jaws
   
   
 step 3Fit the The Anchor
 The PVC Tee is the anchor of the whole contraption. You will wedge it
into the chosen mysterious space in your dashboard. Sheet "craft foam"
is perfect as it is a dense foam that will compress slightly and allow
you to achieve a snug fit. If you don't have the self adhesive variety
you can use regular sheet foam but you'll need some double stick tape or
foam adhesive.
 Measure the length of the arms of your TEE and cut strips of craft foam
to that width.
 I needed 6 total strips 3/4" wide cut off the 11" side of the craft
foam to achieve a snug fit.
 Peel off the backing paper and wrap an equal number of strips around
each of the opposite ends of the PVC TEE (adhesive side to the PVC). I
used 3 strips per side. Press the foam firmly as you go to get a nice
clean finish.
 It will look like a funky little cannon when you're done.
 step 4Attach the other PVC parts
 Thread the street elbow into the foam-free middle tee : I tightened
mine up till it was just snug but not all the way down. This allows me
to adjust the arm once its in place and easily take the whole thing
apart whenever I want.
 Thread the nipple into the street elbow: same deal, just till it's snug
is easier for me but you can tighten this one as much as you wish.
 step 5Fashion a Cradle For Your Device
 This is where the plastic coated wire comes in. If you don't like your
device for some reason feel free to use regular galvanized wire, old
hack saw blades or any other bendable material you have lying around. Or
you can put shrink tube on regular wire. The plastic coating is just
there to keep your phone pretty instead of all getting all scratched up
when you put it in the mount.
 Cut an18"-24" piece of wire and, using the pliers, fashion a suitable
cradle for your device.
 This may require a little experimenting to get something that works
best for you.
 I wanted a minimal but secure hold that left all the buttons and ports
clear for ease of use and charging so I ended up with this "loops on
opposing corners" approach. It looks funky but is incredibly sturdy and
easy to use. I can swing it around my head without any fear of the
iPhone flying to it's death. The phone also snaps easily in and out very
quickly.
 The whole thing is cleaner and sturdier if you can manage to make it
out a single piece of wire.
 Once you have the gripping part sorted out, DO NOT CLIP the excess
wire. Form the excess wire into a a downward pointing "tail" that fits
snugly into the open tube end of the previously assembled PVC nipple. To
make a snug fit, fold the wire a couple times with a bit of "spring".
The plastic coating will also help it grip in the tube. If you can
manage to get both ends of the wire in this tail - all the better as
there will be nothing poky or scratchy to harm you or your device. If
you can't get both ends into the tail then tightly curl and crimp the
errant end with your pliers and tuck it somewhere out of sight.
 Push the cradle tail firmly into the open end of the PVC nipple and
assembly is complete.
 Test fit your device in the cradle and swing it around to see if you
are satisfied with it's sturdiness.
 Alternately - if you already have some kind of holster or other
commercial cradle device feel free to use that instead of making your
own from wire. Or heat form thick plastic sheets/carve from wood/any
other craft you have skills to utilize. Fashion an appropriate way to
attach it to the nipple tube. Gravity is your friend. So is friction.
 Example: if you use a belt clip type holster already you may be able to
just slip the clip into the nipple tube or put a small wire loop on the
end of the nipple that can hold the clip.
 step 6Install in Car
 You'll need no glues, holes or modifications of any kind to the car to
install the mount. Simply wedge the foam covered Tee end of the
contraption firmly into your previously selected dash space and adjust
to your liking.
 That's it. Really.
 On my original Scion XB I have about 14" of space left to right so it's
easy to locate the perfect spot. I placed mine just a bit right of
center to the steering wheel. This visually clears the speedometer and
puts the phone right at my finger tips without impeding steering at all.
The mount can be easily moved at any time.
 Bonus feature: The street elbow creates an adjustable joint. The mount
arm can be easily moved to a different angle or folded out of sight when
not in use without removing it from the dash.
 In drive testing I've found this mount to be completely rock solid on
even the bumpiest roads. It holds the phone firmly for one handed touch
screen use and doesn't shift at all. If yours is a bit loose then add
more layers of foam strips to the PVC tee.
 This is also easy to adapt to multiple devices by simply making
multiple cradles. You can even have nipples of different lengths to
accommodate different positions as they are super easy to swap out.
 Enjoy and drive safely!

*** Make your own laptop docking station slash adapter holder slash

Problem: New Macbook Pro, two offices, lots of peripherals/monitors/etc
to plug in and disconnect at least twice a day.I plug in four to five
different items into my new MacBook Pro with Retina Display every
morning when I get to work. All of these get unplugged at the end of
the day, or alternatively when I leave to go to my other office on the
other side of campus, in which case I'm plugging/unplugging stuff four
times in a day.Aside from the tediousness of it, there's also the issue
of keeping the two display adapters in the proper order so my external
displays aren't swapped back and forth every time I plug in.

have some gaps between the adapters I need to seal up, and the MagSafe
slips out too easily, but otherwise this is a good version 0.1Yes, its
hideous, but it took a total of 5 minutes of work. Turns out the hot
water outlet on the office coffeemaker is the exact right temperature
needed to soften the pellets. Just pour the pellets into a ceramic cup
(don't use paper or styrofoam unless you want the plastic to stick to
the cup), then fill the cup with hot water. Once the pellets turn
clear, they are ready to be formed.  Poor the water out of the mug and
then extract your mass of plastic.I "cooked" too much plastic (about
half the 6oz container) so I broke the glob in half and put the rest
back in the bottle. I rolled the remaining part out with my hands like
you would have in elementary school when making a snake with art clay.
Then I wrapped it around the cables, being sure to press down around
each adapter end and especially in between them. After that's done, you
let it cool until the product turns white again. If you mess up, just
re-heat the product and start all over again.This only took about 1/4 of
the 6oz container, so I have plenty of pellets left to make one for my
other office and will still have 3oz of Instamorph to piddle around
with.
