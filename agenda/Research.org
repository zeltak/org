** PAUSED PM2.5 1kmx1km NEMIA					    :ucurent:
*** Brainstorm
-there may be degredation in data quality in Terra from 2000-2008 may introduce noide, we may need to address this at some stage in the future
-AOD values:
0-1 indicates normal AOD days
0.7-1.2 Days where heavy PM concentrations are transported from elsewhere
2-4 HEavy sand stroms days, days in Africa etc
When you see values of 1.2 in Western counties (IE MA) it is most likley clouds
aod-PM convesion table, is that avilable?
- masking algoryhtm :
for dayswith "." calculate distance to pixel with cloud , then use distance to cloud and maybe a histogram (tail of histogram)?
-LPM- interact lpm with z scores to get spatio-temporal stuff working.
-weights in gamm 3rd stage?
-for non pm2.5 countries perhaps calculate a ratio of Pm10/2.5 by season> imputation> convert pm10 to pm 2.5
*** Decompose local/area
http://svitsrv25.epfl.ch/R-doc/library/quantreg/html/predict.rqss.html
-smooth of top 5%
#+begin_src r
xmat <- ns(x,y)
quantreg(pred~xmat)
#vqss?
#+end_src
-decompose:
1)smooth geo components
2)deviance from smooth will give us the local contribution
*** brent/joel meetings
**** meeting 04.09.13
***** General
maybe try differnet land use and different buffers for LUR terms, like have 2 buffers for a term like tden and try in the model
humidty makes particles grow-interact with aod
interact wdsp*mjrd
penelized spline/n.s for dist to point emission
interactions with pbl/wdsp with source/are emissions
***** LPM
1.normal LPM but with temporal and spatio-temporal interactions
-also talk to steve to make effort to get traffic density by day/week etc, the mesa project maybe bought from someone.
-ask steve about traffic modeling, nescam
-check out Nldas data set (the North American Land Data Assimilation System)
http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/NLDAS2forcing.php

-go over PM25 and see if it looks
*** improvment
run by season
ask california group whats the raw pm-aod correlations
create yearly nox etc variables 
*** TODO check in Israel for next iteration
composition of PM in israel, 
teom at 50 celsius  may over measure and introduce noise to pm25.
look at average residual in monitors 
put that in the paper teom is limited
*** TODO talking to alexei about size distribution
tried latley:
kernel machine approach
PLS
a mean 20km mpm excluding the actual monitoring data. works very well as predictor but we have mod 2 problem. Also David dosent like it.
Tried prev/post AOD as predictor
tried mean of surrounding AOD as predictor. works almost as well as monitor AOD but both linerly don't improve much in model.
both didn't imporve R2 by much 
code 
check email from 26.1.2015 joel 
all vars in log scale , check which one was dropped 

*** NEXT ask joel
even simple pm-aod models show this sharp CV drop

*** talk with david

| mod                      |   r2 | space | time |
| aod                      | 0.77 |   .76 | 0.78 |
| lu+met+intercept for day |   75 |  0.61 | 0.76 |
| aod+all                  | 0.84 |  0.89 | 0.84 |

the use of physical measuremtns gives us the ability to predict in areas far from physics monitors (such as >30km etc) and reach rural area
use of AOD gives us daily predctions over space where LUR cannot
monitors in modest numbers some areas may be under or unrepresented in calibrating the land use regression.

using Aod results in more parsimonious models then LUR- leaves out some Land use terms used in later health outcome models that can create bias since they are included in the exposure

Temperature and wind speed data came from measurements operated by Météo-France. I think Annick Auffray from Météo-France should be a co-author. Note that we need them to approve the paper before submission (it was explicitly written in our contract).
Planetary boundary layer data came from CNRS, Robert Vautard. If needed, he will add something in the paper about the model from which these data come from (50km resolution).
I’ve got population density, hydrology, and traffic data from the IGN (Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière (IGN)) website but I will need to check how we should acknowledge them.

*** 
-consider using other pollutants around the city specifacly indicators for high traffic, use n02 and co and create an indicator where co/pm and no/pm is in the top third and create a high traffic indicator
-similarly try to make an indicator for partical color composition, look at ratio for pm10 and pm2.5
-filter for spatial pattern-cloud contaminated days
-concnerd using teoms Vs filter based (like in the usa) 
-use aeronet site in city to check maiac aod
- interactions for time for almost anything if you run a full model: interact with aod, all LU, all met. each one interacting
- lag terms for every day well have lags:
 pm~aod+aod01
if prev day isnt avilable we use the same day twice
-to borrow information across space create a variable that weights and down weights low aod observations per day

how well the maiac algo does with high OC (organic carbon) in southern italy.
aerosol index OMI- second iteration

from email:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I want to report an interesting discussion I had last week with Daniel Jacob. We have a Indonesian Smoke project, where Daniel's group runs nested GEOS-Chem models for Southeast Asia with fire emissions estimates from a group at Columbia (Ruth DeFries) and I do a health impact assessment. There was one seasonally unusual air pollution peak in Singapore which was due to fires in Indonesia, but AOD did not pick it up. However, the OMI Aerosol Index did. Daniel's group came up with two contributing factors. One is that there was some sand transport from Arabia and and the look up tables do very poorly when dust is mixed with organic carbon. The other is that the AI from OMI is in the near ultraviolet, and organic aerosols are picked up better in that frequency. 
This may have implications for Italy, where there is dust transport, even when there is not a peak event, and where there is wood smoke in the winter. I wonder if we could look at AOD in the 400nm range, or make use of the AI to help with the model?

** Noise pollution Israel- omer harovi
*** sources
**** israel contacts
Shuki Cohen from Matat, or Shlomo may also be able to help you
     
** peripheral artery disease (Andrea)
*** idea
By reading this paper it came back to my mind that there is another orphan cardiovascular disease in air pollution research: peripheral artery disease. This is usually due to atherosclerosis and narrowing of the arteries in the limbs and can lead to severe outcomes such as amputation.
It makes sense to be affected by air pollution, but last time I checked no one had published anything on this. With a large database and geospatial resolution, PAD would be an obvious one to look at.
*** data from antonella
when there is no 2, it means that they are created form first diagnosis, when there is the 2 it means that are created based on 1 and up to 5 secondary diagnosis
so the ones with the 2 should have higher numbers of hospitalizations

*** MAIAC next stages
**** TODO call with Alexei
 cloud cover issue in Mexico; grid cells being masked because of bright surfaces (false clouds) and dropping of clear days
 (long time series with no scene coverage)
Israel data subsets with no raw correlation - Itai will send examples to Alexei (related: not certain why we have big differences
 in R2 from year to year in Israel and Mexico)
dust days not caught by MAIAC (in Israel); Itai and Meytar sending a few examples
(both areas) focus on improving a single year to speed iteration - we nominate 2004 - hopefully this lets us communicate back
 and forth.

We also heard some great suggestions that I am eager to try about TEOM recalibration; characterizing diurnal monitor patterns; comparing aeronet versus the closest monitors; attempting inverse variance weights on AOD; and carefully using both Aqua and Terra.

***** Better error estimation
I have one other idea regarding error estimation. What I previously proposed samples spatial variability in error. We take the annual error in each monitoring location and do a LUR. But there is also temporal variability in at least the GEOS-Chem output, because the chemistry is not perfect and on some days that will matter more. For this I propose the following. On each day, for a region, e.g. New England, we compute the daily rmse. We can then regress these against temporal factors, mostly meteorological.

***** using WRF data for met.pbl etc data (see AE I reviewed)- also look at sattelite derived column no2-from same paper 

***** combine aqua and terra 
I have an idea for combining the satellites but we need to get NE done quickly and I thought we should save it for your Midwest paper. You should expect half or more of the observations to be missing. What is your missing percentage?
Regarding the two satellites you need to remember some stuff from Petros' air pollution course. In the morning the mixing height is low. Local pollution is trapped near the ground, an is a large fraction of particles. It is mostly from traffic or from oil heat in the winter, and so a lot of the particles are black, and a lot are fresh, and hence small. I n the afternoon the mixing height is high, transported particles mix down, and the color and size distribution change. Therefore, the calibration changes. So we need to do the stage 1 calibration separately for each satellite, and then combine, since one is in the morning and one in the afternoon. 
** Ta model (next branch) 
*** stage 3 regression by grid cell
You do not need to run a model with a random effect for each grid cell. Instead, you can run a separate regression for each gridcell, regressing the non-missing predicted Ta against the mean of monitored Ta within 100km. This gives you 1 million regressions to do, but you can divide the gridcells into 100 groups and run 100 jobs on the cluster and it will run in an hour. We do this when we regress the 5000,000 methylation sites against predictors in the NAS.  Also, we need some of the land use terms.

** meytar research topics 


1. PM-MAIAC model in Israel

Predict PM2.5 /PM10 based on MAIAC AOD using mixed effects model following I.Kloogs 

extended model with occurrence of dust events. 

In process

o Examine the relation between PBL measurements from Beit-Dagan and the modeled 

o Examine the use of AIC/BIC tests that take into account the DF to compare model 

PBL. Calibrate the model with AOD, date, temperature and PBL.

results.

2. Analysis of the Spatial coverage of dust events in Israel

- Define dust event in each area based on ground PM10 data and compositional data (?)

- Use satellite data to apply dust classification model on the data

- Analyze the spatial coverage of each event (main goal: showing that not every dust event 

affects the whole country)

In process

3. Analyze the relation between PM hourly (overpass) data and daily data 

- Create a global dataset of all ground data from the overpass hours of Terra(10:30) and 

Aqua(13:30) from (Israel, USA, Europe).

- Analyze diurnal cycles per station and compare daily to hourly PM values. 

- Compare results between correlation to MAIAC/MODIS C06 AOD data with overpass data 

(i.e. mixed effect model).

- Analyze relation between overpass time and daily mean concentrations for all ground 

variables (also dust events) for each station separately and maybe aggregated to regions.

- Discuss the use of daily data and how the overpass data represents the daily mean per 

station ?

Israel part is done, need data from other areas to finish analysis.

4. Understanding the causativeness between the PM2.5/PM10 ratio to the goodness of fit of 

the AOD>>PM model to each PM fraction.

Understanding if different ratios in different areas that are affected from different sources 

reveal different fits. Global database: Israel, USA, Italy, Mexico, Spain etc. 

The hypothesis is that the final graph will look schematically like this:

PM10 PM2.5 

5. class of where dust came and outcome 

R2 

PM2.5/PM10 Ratio 

6. Deep Blue over Israel

Analyze DB data over Israel using collection 6 data (e.g. 10km, combined aod_dt-db) and 

examine PM estimation model using the db especially over bright surfaces. Maybe use dt in 

certain regions and db in others based on a surface reflectance threshold (e.g. optimization 

model that will choose for each pixel what is the best dataset to use, 

DT/DB/Combined/MAIAC, in order to represent PM with the minimum error).

Will it be possible to create DB data in a higher resolution (by ourselves/to receive from 

NASA-A.Sayer/B.Ridgway) ?

7. Understanding the local PM vertical profile

Data from:

(1) Calipso

(2) MPL - Nes Ziona (Karnieli/Smadar - David Please check with her)

(3) Is there any vertical data from Aeronet?

8. PM composition detection using Satellite observations (Israel, Arizona, Spain, Italy, 

Cyprus and more)

- Using PM composition ground measurements as an evaluation.

- Broad cooperation, Large Grant needed 

9. Understanding the limitations of satellite remote sensing over coastal areas

Compare PM estimation ability by AOD over land with data over coastal areas, examine the 

coastal flag in MODIS/MAIAC algorithms.

10. Humidity profile from satellite observations

As the difference in RH between the ground and satellite measurements may derive the 

discrepancies between these measurements, it's worth analyzing the contribution of the 

satellite-borne RH profile and maybe find a RH correction factor to use in PM prediction 

models.

1. מערכות חברתיות-כלכליות הן כאוטיות במהותן ומאד דינמיות, בלתי ניתנות לתחזית ולתכנון. התיאורייה התכנונית ספגה ביקורת רבה במשך שנים - על כך שהיא מבוססת על תחזיות ארוכות טווח ועל תיאוריות "קבועות".
2. על רקע זה, התכנון הולך וזונח את ההתבוננות בתחזיות ארוכות טווח ואת ההתבססות על תוכניות ארוכות טווח. השינוי רלוונטי הן לתיאורייה התכנונית והן לפרקטיקה.
3. בשונה מהמערכות החברתיות-כלכליות, מערכות סביבתיות הן אמנם כאוטיות אבל הרבה פחות דינמיות. מאחר והן גדולות מאד, תהליכי השינוי שלהן הם איטיים. המשמעות היא שניתן ברמה גבוהה של וודאות לייצר תחזיות טובות ואפילו טובות מאד לכמה עשרות שנים קדימה.
4. הבעייה: התיאורייה התכנונית פסלה את ההתבססות על תוכניות ארוכות טווח, והפרקטיקה התכנונית אינה בנוייה להתחשבות בתחזיות ארוכות טווח. כך קורה, שבישראל אנחנו הולכים לקראת קטסטרופה אקלימית צפויה וודאית - ואין כלים שיעזרו לתכנון להימנע מכך. הכלים הקיימים מתבוננים במציאות הנוכחית, ולא מסוגלים להתמודד עם מה שיהיה (בוודאות רבה מאד) בעוד 50 שנה.

-also to check if the association changed from year to year we will run these exact models by year (IE each year speratley in a seperate model) !note! remember to change the DF for the dats spline for 1 year
!note! once can run the same model instead of yearly in 1 model with all year with interactions so that each pollutant interacts with a year variable, but you need a very large N`

1. A paragraph on how the hybrid satellite model is an advancement on previous exposure methods:
Previous exposure methods have primarily used either assignment of exposure from central site monitors or parameterization of estimates based on land use regression (LUR) using spatial covariates. Individuals that live further from central site monitors may be assigned estimates with more error in this first approach which also does not account for spatial determinants of exposure such as living in an area with heavy traffic. Land use regression may better capture this spatial variability but typically doesn't include short term temporal variation. Error in assigning exposures can bias effect estimates (likely towards the null) and decrease the power to detect true associations. The hybrid satellite model uses the strengths of both exposure modeling approaches and adds in physical measurements of aerosol optical depth calibrated against the trusted ground monitoring network of central sites while accounting for local variability in spatial determinants of exposure such as roadway density.
 
2. A short statement on how we can collaborate with the geospatial institute:
Because vehicular emissions are a large contributor to PM2.5 concentrations, we will work with the Geospatial  Institute to develop measures of traffic that can serve as proxies for vehicular emissions to augment future iterations of the exposure model. In particular, metrics of roadway usage and fleet composition (e.g. diesel buses and trucks) that reflect historic and present patterns of traffic and that vary in both space and time are expected to improve on our currently implemented roadway density measures.
 
3. A summary of what GIS info/help we could use right away that can be forwarded to Martine?
We need some help with finding GIS data for political boundaries since we are currently building our models for an arbitrarily selected rectangular area. In particular, it would be very helpful to get a GIS shapefile delineating the boundaries of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (particularly if it clarified the boundaries of the DF vs included municipios from outlying areas like in the State of Mexico). Also, it would be great in the future to know the boundaries of the "megalopolis" and include the boundaries of the component states. 
 
We already have a shapefile with the AGEBs from the INEGI which has been joined to the 2010 census population counts so perhaps we are okay on that for now.
 
here is a quick paragraph on some epi methods for different kinds of health data.

Associations between air pollution and individual level health outcomes will be tested with generalized linear mixed models that account for the potential unexplained correlation of survey participants coming from the same census units. Count based (ecologic) data will be fit with negative binomial regression allowing for overdispersion and using a population offset. Models for dichotomous outcomes will be fit using relative risk regression with modified poisson links in order to estimate risk ratios rather than odds ratios and to avoid apparent interaction in the odds ratio that can be due to differences in outcome prevalence between socioeconomic strata. Interaction will be assessed as departure from additivity and thus, in multiplicative models will be assessed using the relative excess risk due to interaction. Potential confounders will be derived from previous literature on the health impacts of air pollution and considered for inclusion after the construction of directed acyclic graphs. ### PUT SOME EXAMPLES HERE - PERHAPS I WOULD CONSIDER SEASON AND LONG TERM TIME TREND IN ADDITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS LIKE SEX AGE EDUCATION AND SMOKING DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU HAVE ###


I would also consider the hypothesis that social context is important and that individual SES responses on the health survey could be augmented with census based SES about the neighborhood and accommodated in this mixed model framework - for example, is it the same thing to be poor in a wealthy neighborhood than it is to be of lower means but similar to everyone around you? That could be another area where you work with the geospatial institute to derive neighborhood metrics.

-initial israel model-paper coming in the next few days
-work in Europe (mainly in Italy but also in sweeden and switzerland and soon other regions)
*** current issues to discuss:
**** MAIAC RAW results in all NE areas we tried (Mexico, Israel etc) much worse. is it a mater of physics?
all other regions such as Israel, Mexico, italy, SE USA have all relatively poor overall RAW R2 (monitors vs closest AOD) much lower than NE:
in NE it ranges from 0.2-0.7 RAW while in all other regions RAW of 0.01-0.2 MAX
bright surfaces (in California) get better agreement with aeronet; also in israel
0.6017
is MAIAC better at prediccting the uper column than surface in israel? 
what can we do to help this (bright surface problem)

**** PM10 in Israel performs much better than PM2.5
the differences are huge- CV R2 pm10=0.82 and pm25 ~0.7
over fitting isn't the issue since also in a parsimonious model we still get this drop
