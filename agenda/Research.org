** PAUSED PM2.5 1kmx1km NEMIA					    :ucurent:
*** Brainstorm
-there may be degredation in data quality in Terra from 2000-2008 may introduce noide, we may need to address this at some stage in the future
-AOD values:
0-1 indicates normal AOD days
0.7-1.2 Days where heavy PM concentrations are transported from elsewhere
2-4 HEavy sand stroms days, days in Africa etc
When you see values of 1.2 in Western counties (IE MA) it is most likley clouds
aod-PM convesion table, is that avilable?
- masking algoryhtm :
for dayswith "." calculate distance to pixel with cloud , then use distance to cloud and maybe a histogram (tail of histogram)?
-LPM- interact lpm with z scores to get spatio-temporal stuff working.
-weights in gamm 3rd stage?
-for non pm2.5 countries perhaps calculate a ratio of Pm10/2.5 by season> imputation> convert pm10 to pm 2.5
*** Decompose local/area
http://svitsrv25.epfl.ch/R-doc/library/quantreg/html/predict.rqss.html
-smooth of top 5%
#+begin_src r
xmat <- ns(x,y)
quantreg(pred~xmat)
#vqss?
#+end_src
-decompose:
1)smooth geo components
2)deviance from smooth will give us the local contribution
*** brent/joel meetings
**** meeting 04.09.13
***** General
maybe try differnet land use and different buffers for LUR terms, like have 2 buffers for a term like tden and try in the model
humidty makes particles grow-interact with aod
interact wdsp*mjrd
penelized spline/n.s for dist to point emission
interactions with pbl/wdsp with source/are emissions
***** LPM
1.normal LPM but with temporal and spatio-temporal interactions
-also talk to steve to make effort to get traffic density by day/week etc, the mesa project maybe bought from someone.
-ask steve about traffic modeling, nescam
-check out Nldas data set (the North American Land Data Assimilation System)

-consider using other pollutants around the city specifacly indicators for high traffic, use n02 and co and create an indicator where co/pm and no/pm is in the top third and create a high traffic indicator
-similarly try to make an indicator for partical color composition, look at ratio for pm10 and pm2.5
-filter for spatial pattern-cloud contaminated days
-concnerd using teoms Vs filter based (like in the usa) 
-use aeronet site in city to check maiac aod
- interactions for time for almost anything if you run a full model: interact with aod, all LU, all met. each one interacting
- lag terms for every day well have lags:
 pm~aod+aod01
if prev day isnt avilable we use the same day twice
-to borrow information across space create a variable that weights and down weights low aod observations per day
** Italy PM models
*** Diffrances then NE paper:
- in in europe
- mountanius regions in north mediteranian climate in south
-Submit to a Euro journal
-compare the model to the ESCAPE LUR models, show how we do much
better
-compare in Brecsia- the town with and without smellter, talk to
Brent about this
-regress log of pm vs log of aod and all variables
-we have multicliple model so all interactions are build in

- aod in upwind squere is excellent predictor for a specifc grid cell 
avg Per day, weighted average per grid cell

comparing multiple resolution models to better charecterize fine particulate matter in urban Environments:
years 2003-2008
Boston, Worcster, NYC, Newark

-fig 1: 10x10 NE usa 10x10 and 1x1km NE USA
-plot 2: box plot of true pm and pm 10km vs 1km per ( and maybe 200) city and by season
range of true PM, pred 10, pred 1-check ranges in each 
-plot 3: distances from main roads and/or urban rings and levels of PM: take NYC and boston and see how much the levels of pm go down for each few km's from the city: downtown, surrondings area, outer core , rural
-plot 4: transported pm by trajectories and thresholds
-discussion: show how you might underestimate the health effect (exposure bias)
maiac is similar to modis but much more obsrv with more variability


comparing rural vs urban areas, comparing cities by decreasing populations
comparing 10x10,3x3,1x1,200x200
X-city size or popultaion  and scale Y-PM and create 3 box plots 10,1,200
season-same as above
range of variablilty of 1x1m pixels within a 10x10km model.

**** Future models ideas
***** supplementing AOD by space and time
space: perhaps taking aod from 9 adjacent cells
time: take from prev/next day if no AOD avilable today
also we can maybe weight nearby cells by missingness/distance
***** calculate for each day the corr between monitor and surronding AOD point in a X distance and take the highest correlation:
it may be that the closest AOD point does not neccesarly correlate the best in a given point/day due to:
modis isn't fixed and we are getting the centroid of the grid
there maybe LU/temporal variables that are not centroid specific 
***** Try removing (in mod1&2) aodid gridcells that have very few passable days (<100) :newdata:
since they may have ground conditions that are weird
***** incorperate 3x3 data to supplument 1x1 data
***** cover less densly populated areas across USA with 3x3 data 
***** look into predicting with a spatial correlation matrix (with nested days)
***** check correlations in specific monitors to see if some prefrom a lot worse and try to charetarise these
      
***** smoothing of the residuals-lucas neas suggestion
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
resid~ LU+MET+Interactions+ s(x,y)
#+END_SRC
***** Take those smoothed surfaces from stage 3 and put them into stage 1 as another predictor, and if CV R2 goes up, use them?
***** mod1 take the mean of the nonmissing aod's from the immediately surrounding cells, subtracted the aod from the cell with the monitor, and put that difference into the model to perhaps better capture the more slowly changing particle concentrations, and hence increasing spatial R2
***** Use aeronet - maybe as a super-monitor (weighted?) Use other satellite data
***** -look into auto correlation between the random slops of stage one: there is a R function (ACF? auto correlation function)
      
** alexei-black body radiation. black particles are going to observer and scatter roughly the same ammount vs other particles wont. it might be possible in NEW-England at least to use that information on how to use the diff on wave lenghts in aod for BC model.
** peripheral artery disease (Andrea )
By reading this paper it came back to my mind that there is another orphan cardiovascular disease in air pollution research: peripheral artery disease. This is usually due to atherosclerosis and narrowing of the arteries in the limbs and can lead to severe outcomes such as amputation.
It makes sense to be affected by air pollution, but last time I checked no one had published anything on this. With a large database and geospatial resolution, PAD would be an obvious one to look at.

*** meeting with jamie
**** 15.7.2013 prepare MA datasets of temp,PM,NDVI,SES stuff and other perhaps to prepare to the regression tree
-look into Ozone (O3) and sat. data for possible future modeling
-So2 is very low in the usa, better to look at NO2
-NDVI as an exposure
-Noise is very hard to model, no noise data, height, buliding material etc
-walkabilty
-comapre urban vs rural and citiy vs city (Boston Vs New York)
-access to food places (such as supermarket etc) - can use google maps for that maybe
-maps to create shape files
-mcast scores in MA (standerized tests), this test is taken by all MA students> can be used as an outcome
-conn health data (birth weight)
*** stat metoods
**** regression tree speciffacly random forest
-regression trees (usually run in R) are like informative clustering with health end points> exposure
-the theory is to put all exousre variables (with temporal variation not SES etc) and it will give you for the specific outcome what the most important one is. its like running all these interactions for ll the exposuresi
-the random forst is an attempty to make it more robust, and see which Variable (exposres in our case) is most important
**** Check Mboost R package for regression trees

** Look into developing spatio temporal ozone (O3) modles from sattelite in USA
** Compare our BW study with low "western world" effetcs to a high polluted (mexico city) area
** Temerature model results and Liu CMAQ results
   -look at mortality cases and temperature (short term, acute temprature days), and compare results with our model and CMAQ
** go back to the ICAM/VCAM reanalysis
-stacey re-analysis with 1kmx1km data :: We should say that we see an effect for both the year lag and medium term but the longer lag is more important
-calculate the residuals between our model and the BC model
create moving averages of the 4,8,12 weeks and try that in the model> will capture only non traffic exposures
when we get the 1x1km data ready go back to the icam/vcam reanalysis by marie-able and the stacey BC paper and see if that changes things

-also to check if the association changed from year to year we will run these exact models by year (IE each year speratley in a seperate model) !note! remember to change the DF for the dats spline for 1 year
!note! once can run the same model instead of yearly in 1 model with all year with interactions so that each pollutant interacts with a year variable, but you need a very large N`

**** What is the original paper in which you described the methodology of creating those datasets?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Kloog, I., A.A. Chudnovsky, A.C. Just, F. Nordio, P. Koutrakis, B.A. Coull, A. Lyapustin, Y. Wang, and J. Schwartz (2014). A new hybrid spatio-temporal model for estimating daily multi-year PM2.5 concentrations across northeastern USA using high resolution aerosol optical depth data Atmos. Env, 95, 581-590

#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Ways of comparing R-square, including how you “assign” AOD-derived estimation from regular grid points to monitoring site. I was looking for the nearest grid point for each monitoring site (I think this is the key difference). Is this the method you were using?

We also used the nearest AOD point per day to each monitor station. We used 2 techniques:
***** python method (old) 
Initially we used a GIS based method to subset the data into only data points within 1.5 km from a PM monitor station. Then we did daily spatial joins (using a python script) to assign in each day for each monitor the closest AOD point at that specific date. This resulted in a new database (per year) that looked like this:

| Date | PM_ID | PM25 | AOD | AOD_ID |
|    1 | x1    |   11 | 0.3 | y1     |
|    2 | x1    |   12 | 0.2 | y2     |
|      |       |      |     |        |
 
***** R KNN method
With the 1x1km data we switched to using a R function we created, see here:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
# function to assign closest
# merge data by day to the closest of K nearest neighbors (with a distance constraint)
# could be better (not require merge for left join afterwards)
# see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12450918
nearestbyday <- function(matrix1, matrix2, dt1, dt2, dt1varname, dt2varname, 
                         closestname = "closestmet", varstoget = "avewsp", 
                         knearest = 5, maxdistance = NA){
  require(FNN)
  knearest <- min(knearest, nrow(matrix2))
  knnname <- paste0(closestname, "knn")
  nobsname <- paste0(closestname, "nobs")
  # calculate nearest neighbors using package FNN
  knn_store <- get.knnx(matrix2, matrix1, k = knearest)
  # restrict by distance
  if(!is.na(maxdistance)){
    knn_store[["nn.dist"]][knn_store[["nn.dist"]] > maxdistance] <- NA
    knn_store[["nn.index"]] <- knn_store[["nn.index"]] * (knn_store[["nn.dist"]] * 0 + 1)
  }
  # store the indices for nearest neighbors in a long DT
  knn_out <- data.table(matrix(knn_store[["nn.index"]])) 
  knn_out[, dt1varname := rep(rownames(matrix1), knearest), with = F]
  knn_out[, closestname := as.character(row.names(matrix2[knn_out[, V1],])), with = F]
  knn_out[, V1 := NULL]
  knn_out[, knnname := rep(1:knearest, each = nrow(matrix1)), with = F]
  # drop points not within maxdistance
  knn_out <- knn_out[!is.na(get(closestname))]
  # use setkeyv to pass a column by name
  setkeyv(knn_out, closestname)
  setnames(dt2, dt2varname, closestname)
  # if not character - coerce
  if(class(dt2[,closestname,with = F][[1]]) != "character"){
    dt2[, closestname := as.character(closestname), with = F]
  }
  setkeyv(dt2, closestname)
  # lengthen dt2 with every possible site each day might match
  # after dropping missing observations
  dt2long <- dt2[!is.na(get(varstoget))][knn_out, allow.cartesian = T]
  # store the number of valid observations
  dt2long[, nobsname := .N, by=c(dt1varname,"day"), with = F]
  setkeyv(dt2long, cols = c(dt1varname, "day", knnname))
  # join to itself (set1 and day are keys) and take first record for fast selection
  closestvar <- dt2long[unique(dt2long[,c(dt1varname, "day"), with = F]), mult = "first"]
  gc()# clear memory
  # put the name back in dt2
  setnames(dt2, closestname, dt2varname)
  # inspect our result
  print(tables(silent = T)[NAME == "closestvar"])
  # return it silently
  invisible(closestvar)
}


makepointsmatrix <- function(datatable, xvar, yvar, idvar) {
  dtnames <- names(datatable)
  unique.dt <- unique(datatable[,c(xvar,yvar, idvar), with = F])
  out.m <- as.matrix(unique.dt[,c(xvar,yvar), with = F])
  dimnames(out.m)[[1]] <- unique.dt[,idvar, with = F][[1]]
  invisible(out.m)
}

#+END_SRC

we then use a script that goes through the days and assigns for each station in each day again the closet AOD point. 
here is the R script:

#+BEGIN_SRC R

setkey(closestaod,SiteCode,day)

#+END_SRC

Let me know if its similar to your methods. If not and you would like to use one of the above methods i would be happy to help you set it up.

**** What is the way of using road density (they are raster file format with grid width maybe about 50 meters) did you interpolate raster values or just find the exact raster cell in which monitoring site lies. I guess the general question is---what is the general method of assigning value to each monitoring site if it is raster data file?
What we did was aggregate/disaggregate all LU/MET/Etc variables to the 1x1km Level from the study grid that we created based on the AOD data centroid. we used the Lat/Long to create the unique grid id (we call it guid in the scripts) and then calculate all the LU/MET terms for these 1x1km using several methods such as weighted averages for population density etc. specifacly if i recall for road density we create a raster of line density from the all lanes (A1,A2,A3) across MIA using in GIS:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
spatial analysit>density>Line density
#+END_EXAMPLE
This results in a Raster file with the "traffic density" (tden)

**** In your paper “Assessing temporally and spatially resolved PM2.5 exposures for epidemiological studies using satellite aerosol optical depth measurements”, you mentioned that you were finding the nearest weather station and assign meteorological data from that station to the monitoring site--- is this the same method you were using when creating 1-km estimation? 
yes that is the same methods we used in the last 1x1km paper. that data should also be on the server (NCDC and EPA met data)
