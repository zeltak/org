* how to use
** Refrences
use org-bibtex-yank to 'paste' a single reference thats been yanked(copied to kill ring)
In example open a bibtex file/snippet and copy to kill ring ('y' in evil mode) 

then use 'org-bibtex-export-to-kill-ring' while standing on an org header to export that refrence back to bibtex format

** Columns 
to sort by multiple criteria first sort by one the by the other:
In example to sort by year published and then todo do this: sort by property (r) and choose year as property. then sort by todo state

** PAUSED PM2.5 1kmx1km NEMIA					    :ucurent:
*** Brainstorm
-there may be degredation in data quality in Terra from 2000-2008 may introduce noide, we may need to address this at some stage in the future
-AOD values:
0-1 indicates normal AOD days
0.7-1.2 Days where heavy PM concentrations are transported from elsewhere
2-4 HEavy sand stroms days, days in Africa etc

When you see values of 1.2 in Western counties (IE MA) it is most likley clouds

aod-PM convesion table, is that avilable?

- masking algoryhtm :

for dayswith "." calculate distance to pixel with cloud , then use distance to cloud and maybe a histogram (tail of histogram)?

-LPM- interact lpm with z scores to get spatio-temporal stuff working.

-weights in gamm 3rd stage?

-for non pm2.5 countries perhaps calculate a ratio of Pm10/2.5 by season> imputation> convert pm10 to pm 2.5

*** model ideas
-look into predicting with a spatial correlation matrix (with nested days)
-try subtracting monitor elev-pbl to see of that helps
- look at correlation table of all LU variables with med_income to see which ones to take out for health studies
-look into auto correlation between the random slops of stage one: there is a R function (ACF? auto correlation function)

*** Decompose local/area
http://svitsrv25.epfl.ch/R-doc/library/quantreg/html/predict.rqss.html

-smooth of top 5%

#+begin_src r
xmat <- ns(x,y)
quantreg(pred~xmat)
#vqss?
#+end_src

-decompose:
1)smooth geo components
2)deviance from smooth will give us the local contribution
*** brent/joel meetings
**** meeting 04.09.13
***** General
maybe try differnet land use and different buffers for LUR terms, like have 2 buffers for a term like tden and try in the model
humidty makes particles grow-interact with aod
interact wdsp*mjrd
penelized spline/n.s for dist to point emission
interactions with pbl/wdsp with source/are emissions
***** LPM
1.normal LPM but with temporal and spatio-temporal interactions
-also talk to steve to make effort to get traffic density by day/week etc, the mesa project maybe bought from someone.
-ask steve about traffic modeling, nescam
-check out Nldas data set (the North American Land Data Assimilation System)
http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/NLDAS2forcing.php

***** look into predicting with a spatial correlation matrix (with nested days)

resid~ LU+MET+Interactions+ s(x,y)
#+END_SRC
***** Take those smoothed surfaces from stage 3 and put them into stage 1 as another predictor, and if CV R2 goes up, use them?
***** mod1 take the mean of the nonmissing aod's from the immediately surrounding cells, subtracted the aod from the cell with the monitor, and put that difference into the model to perhaps better capture the more slowly changing particle concentrations, and hence increasing spatial R2

** alexandra
*** comparison paper spatial and temporal scaling of sattelite based models
- comparing model outputs of various spatial resolution
comparing rural vs urban areas, comparing cities by decreasing populations
distances from main roads and levels of PM
comparing 10x10,3x3,1x1,200x200
take boston,NY, Vs ruran area
X-city size or popultaion  and scale Y-PM and create 3 box plots 10,1,200
season-same as above
maiac is similar to modis but much more obsrv with more variability
range of true PM, pred 10, pred 1-check ranges in each 
range of variablilty of 1x1m pixels within a 10x10km model.

** Multi Pollutant project-living in the modern environment (with Jamie)
*** meeting with jamie
**** 15.7.2013 prepare MA datasets of temp,PM,NDVI,SES stuff and other perhaps to prepare to the regression tree

-look into Ozone (O3) and sat. data for possible future modeling
-So2 is very low in the usa, better to look at NO2
-NDVI as an exposure
-Noise is very hard to model, no noise data, height, buliding material etc
-walkabilty
-comapre urban vs rural and citiy vs city (Boston Vs New York)
-access to food places (such as supermarket etc) - can use google maps for that maybe
-maps to create shape files
-mcast scores in MA (standerized tests), this test is taken by all MA students> can be used as an outcome
-conn health data (birth weight)
*** stat metoods
**** regression tree speciffacly random forest
-regression trees (usually run in R) are like informative clustering with health end points> exposure
-the theory is to put all exousre variables (with temporal variation not SES etc) and it will give you for the specific outcome what the most important one is. its like running all these interactions for ll the exposuresi
-the random forst is an attempty to make it more robust, and see which Variable (exposres in our case) is most important
**** Check Mboost R package for regression trees
** Italy PM models
*** Diffrances then NE paper:
- in in europe
- mountanius regions in north mediteranian climate in south

Nepal- few monitos, only specific years and then they stopped
Asia- Japan etc
study of nursing home cases, dont move much good for 1x1 km data

** Joel NAS paper about no correlation with SES and PM, try with 1km data
** Look into developing spatio temporal ozone (O3) modles from sattelite
** Look into developing spatio temporal Nox modles from sattelite
** Compare our BW study with low "western world" effetcs to a high polluted (mexico city) area
** Temerature model results and Liu CMAQ results
   -look at mortality cases and temperature (short term, acute temprature days), and compare results with our model and CMAQ
** go back to the ICAM/VCAM reanalysis
-stacey re-analysis with 1kmx1km data :: We should say that we see an effect for both the year lag and medium term but the longer lag is more important
-calculate the residuals between our model and the BC model
create moving averages of the 4,8,12 weeks and try that in the model> will capture only non traffic exposures
when we get the 1x1km data ready go back to the icam/vcam reanalysis by marie-able and the stacey BC paper and see if that changes things

-run a poisson regression where we regress counts by zipcode and day (like 10x10 NE) ~1 year lags of the pollutants, and a spline for date (See 10x10 code). this will be run togheter for 10 years
-also to check if the association changed from year to year we will run these exact models by year (IE each year speratley in a seperate model) !note! remember to change the DF for the dats spline for 1 year
!note! once can run the same model instead of yearly in 1 model with all year with interactions so that each pollutant interacts with a year variable, but you need a very large N`

-consider using other pollutants around the city specifacly indicators for high traffic, use n02 and co and create an indicator where co/pm and no/pm is in the top third and create a high traffic indicator
-similarly try to make an indicator for partical color composition, look at ratio for pm10 and pm2.5
-filter for spatial pattern-cloud contaminated days
-concnerd using teoms Vs filter based (like in the usa) 
-use aeronet site in city to check maiac aod
- interactions for time for almost anything if you run a full model: interact with aod, all LU, all met. each one interacting
- lag terms for every day well have lags:
 pm~aod+aod01
if prev day isnt avilable we use the same day twice
-to borrow information across space create a variable that weights and down weights low aod observations per day
