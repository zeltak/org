** PAUSED PM2.5 1kmx1km NEMIA					    :ucurent:
*** Brainstorm
-there may be degredation in data quality in Terra from 2000-2008 may introduce noide, we may need to address this at some stage in the future
-AOD values:
0-1 indicates normal AOD days
0.7-1.2 Days where heavy PM concentrations are transported from elsewhere
2-4 HEavy sand stroms days, days in Africa etc
When you see values of 1.2 in Western counties (IE MA) it is most likley clouds
aod-PM convesion table, is that avilable?
- masking algoryhtm :
for dayswith "." calculate distance to pixel with cloud , then use distance to cloud and maybe a histogram (tail of histogram)?
-LPM- interact lpm with z scores to get spatio-temporal stuff working.
-weights in gamm 3rd stage?
-for non pm2.5 countries perhaps calculate a ratio of Pm10/2.5 by season> imputation> convert pm10 to pm 2.5
*** model ideas
-look into predicting with a spatial correlation matrix (with nested days)
-try subtracting monitor elev-pbl to see of that helps
- look at correlation table of all LU variables with med_income to see which ones to take out for health studies
-look into auto correlation between the random slops of stage one: there is a R function (ACF? auto correlation function)
*** Decompose local/area
http://svitsrv25.epfl.ch/R-doc/library/quantreg/html/predict.rqss.html
-smooth of top 5%
#+begin_src r
xmat <- ns(x,y)
quantreg(pred~xmat)
#vqss?
#+end_src
-decompose:
1)smooth geo components
2)deviance from smooth will give us the local contribution
*** brent/joel meetings
**** meeting 04.09.13
***** General
maybe try differnet land use and different buffers for LUR terms, like have 2 buffers for a term like tden and try in the model
humidty makes particles grow-interact with aod
interact wdsp*mjrd
penelized spline/n.s for dist to point emission
interactions with pbl/wdsp with source/are emissions
***** LPM
1.normal LPM but with temporal and spatio-temporal interactions
-also talk to steve to make effort to get traffic density by day/week etc, the mesa project maybe bought from someone.
-ask steve about traffic modeling, nescam
-check out Nldas data set (the North American Land Data Assimilation System)
http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/NLDAS2forcing.php

for the paper: the adv of 1x1km aod data is it allows for a simpler model
in the discussion compare our model to the liu paper and the seattle's group paper, one advantage of ours is the ability to get daily predictions for acute studies

*** mexico joels ideas
-consider using other pollutants around the city specifacly indicators for high traffic, use n02 and co and create an indicator where co/pm and no/pm is in the top third and create a high traffic indicator
-similarly try to make an indicator for partical color composition, look at ratio for pm10 and pm2.5
-filter for spatial pattern-cloud contaminated days
-concnerd using teoms Vs filter based (like in the usa) 
-use aeronet site in city to check maiac aod
- interactions for time for almost anything if you run a full model: interact with aod, all LU, all met. each one interacting
- lag terms for every day well have lags:
 pm~aod+aod01
if prev day isnt avilable we use the same day twice
-to borrow information across space create a variable that weights and down weights low aod observations per day
** Italy PM models
*** Diffrances then NE paper:
- in in europe
- mountanius regions in north mediteranian climate in south
-Submit to a Euro journal
-compare the model to the ESCAPE LUR models, show how we do much
better
-compare in Brecsia- the town with and without smellter, talk to
Brent about this
-regress log of pm vs log of aod and all variables
-we have multicliple model so all interactions are build in

- aod in upwind squere is excellent predictor for a specifc grid cell 
avg Per day, weighted average per grid cell

-plot 4: transported pm by trajectories and thresholds
-discussion: show how you might underestimate the health effect (exposure bias)

***** look into predicting with a spatial correlation matrix (with nested days)
***** smoothing of the residuals-lucas neas suggestion
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
resid~ LU+MET+Interactions+ s(x,y)
#+END_SRC
***** Take those smoothed surfaces from stage 3 and put them into stage 1 as another predictor, and if CV R2 goes up, use them?
***** mod1 take the mean of the nonmissing aod's from the immediately surrounding cells, subtracted the aod from the cell with the monitor, and put that difference into the model to perhaps better capture the more slowly changing particle concentrations, and hence increasing spatial R2
** alexei-black body radiation. black particles are going to observer and scatter roughly the same ammount vs other particles wont. it might be possible in NEW-England at least to use that information on how to use the diff on wave lenghts in aod for BC model.
** peripheral artery disease (Andrea )
By reading this paper it came back to my mind that there is another orphan cardiovascular disease in air pollution research: peripheral artery disease. This is usually due to atherosclerosis and narrowing of the arteries in the limbs and can lead to severe outcomes such as amputation.
It makes sense to be affected by air pollution, but last time I checked no one had published anything on this. With a large database and geospatial resolution, PAD would be an obvious one to look at.

** Multi Pollutant project-living in the modern environment (with Jamie)
*** meeting with jamie
**** 15.7.2013 prepare MA datasets of temp,PM,NDVI,SES stuff and other perhaps to prepare to the regression tree
-look into Ozone (O3) and sat. data for possible future modeling
-So2 is very low in the usa, better to look at NO2
-NDVI as an exposure
-Noise is very hard to model, no noise data, height, buliding material etc
-walkabilty
-comapre urban vs rural and citiy vs city (Boston Vs New York)
-access to food places (such as supermarket etc) - can use google maps for that maybe
-maps to create shape files
-mcast scores in MA (standerized tests), this test is taken by all MA students> can be used as an outcome
-conn health data (birth weight)
*** stat metoods
**** regression tree speciffacly random forest
-regression trees (usually run in R) are like informative clustering with health end points> exposure
-the theory is to put all exousre variables (with temporal variation not SES etc) and it will give you for the specific outcome what the most important one is. its like running all these interactions for ll the exposuresi
-the random forst is an attempty to make it more robust, and see which Variable (exposres in our case) is most important
**** Check Mboost R package for regression trees
*** things to look at as exposures
-urban form
-wakability
-prox to hospitals
-socio economic disatvanteges measures
-urban classification

** Michelle bell colaboration-Conn data, maybe other world areas brasil etc
Wants to use 1x1km temp data for health studies that we are not going to persue
very intrested in other parts of the world as well:
Brasil (sau paolo -lots of monitors but spatialy all clustered)
Nepal- few monitos, only specific years and then they stopped
Asia- Japan etc
study of nursing home cases, dont move much good for 1x1 km data
** Joel NAS paper about no correlation with SES and PM, try with 1km data
** Look into developing spatio temporal ozone (O3) modles from sattelite in USA
** Compare our BW study with low "western world" effetcs to a high polluted (mexico city) area
** Temerature model results and Liu CMAQ results
   -look at mortality cases and temperature (short term, acute temprature days), and compare results with our model and CMAQ
** go back to the ICAM/VCAM reanalysis
-stacey re-analysis with 1kmx1km data :: We should say that we see an effect for both the year lag and medium term but the longer lag is more important
-calculate the residuals between our model and the BC model
create moving averages of the 4,8,12 weeks and try that in the model> will capture only non traffic exposures
when we get the 1x1km data ready go back to the icam/vcam reanalysis by marie-able and the stacey BC paper and see if that changes things

-also to check if the association changed from year to year we will run these exact models by year (IE each year speratley in a seperate model) !note! remember to change the DF for the dats spline for 1 year
!note! once can run the same model instead of yearly in 1 model with all year with interactions so that each pollutant interacts with a year variable, but you need a very large N`
