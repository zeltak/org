you can create a neartable so that each p10 monitor gets the closest pm10/25 calibrated station to it and then this is used to predict these pm10 data
 as extra validation you can check the R2 in the closest stations to the 10/25 ones and see how this prefroms

 run cmaq for svoc for the haifa region?

for the morning/afternoon terrr/aqua alex project we can use a nueral network perhaps to fill in aod points so we can also have a third overall aqua-teraa exposure (we don't need to deal with the issues of missingenss)

NOAA automated high splits. look at back trajectories and see where the come from. if from africa etc it could be a good dust indicator

we can interact aod and fractions from ctm models on the ground level , perhaps use a nueral netwrok 

use nueral netwroks in mexico city
** REFILES allan meeting
I’ll try to review some of our old code to be somewhat up to speed perhaps.


Mexico model task list:

    Implement IDW
    SVM for stage 1 (exploring random components)
        Or fit random effects without covariates and then use the “calibrated aod” as a predictor in SVM
    Ask Meytar’s help on identifying aeronet station at UNAM
    Can we estimate a mod1 coefficient for days without any mod1 (monitor coverage) based on AOD average and monitor average
    Local smoothing of AOD weighted by surface reflectance
    Anything we can borrow from Aaron Van Donkelaar (sp?) approach?



Technical reminders for Alexei: 

    can we use colocated PM2.5 and aeronet to improve MAIAC.
    Can he add a processing path indicator
    Dynamic particle size model (we can send summary of seasons)

Subject: Academic Cooperation between geography departments

Dear prof. {perhaps better to our contact person for him to present the initiative to his Chair}

I am writing to you on behalf of the Chair and all faculty members of the Department of Geography and Environmental Development, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. 

I'm a faculty member of the department and I'm in charge of pursuing strong academic cooperation's with leading geography departments. Since there are already strong existing cooperation's between researchers from our departments ({ENTER NAMES OF RESEARCHERS HERE}) we thought that this could be a good opportunity to discuss further expansion of collaboration between our departments. Such a collaboration may allow to increase diversity in knowledge and perhaps share resources.  

Examples for such a collaboration could be:

a. Actively hosting and joining short-term visits and other exchange activities organized by  each department; 
b. Setting up a platform for scientific exchange between the two universities; 
c. Sharing reviewing efforts and supervision for theses and dissertations; 
d. Encouraging faculty members to write joint grant proposals for governmental financing   bodies; 
e. Exploring educational cooperation's between the departments such as developing on-line courses; 
f. Other?

Please let me know if your department may have interest in such a cooperation and if so perhaps we can organize a web meeting or web call to further discuss how to move forward.

Kind regards

Dr. Itai Kloog
The Department of Geography and Environmental Development Ben-Gurion University of the Negev P.O.B. 653 Beer Sheva Israel http://www.bgu.ac.il

A very brief introduction of our department: We are one of the leading geography departments in Israel, with world renowned and prolific researchers in multidisciplinary fields of geography. We have three main study programs in GIT (Geographic Information Technologies), Physical Geography and Human Geography. We have over 9 laboratories headed by our faculty members (Geomorphology Laboratory, Earth and Planetary Image Facility (EPIF),Geographic Information Laboratory (GI-Lab), The Geo-Ecology Laboratory, Soil and Desert Dust Laboratory, Aeolian Simulation Laboratory, Planning Laboratory, The Sustainability and Environmental Policy Laboratory and Environmental exposure assessment Laboratory. We have strong global collaborations with well-respected institutions such as: Harvard, Cornell, Brown, Arizona State University, Southampton University, Imperial College, Curtin University and many others.

 The function of each author of an article should be indicated by means of the addition of a letter in superscript (or in parentheses) after the name, as follows: Principal Investigator PI, student S, post-doctoral fellow PD, co-researcher C, technician/laboratory assistant T. More than one author may serve in a particular category, including Principal Investigator in multi-disciplinary works.

** bob job talk
*** start
-thanks so much for the opportunity to visit MS.
-ill start by saying that academically there is no dilemma- amazing team, on par with anywhere globally- you did an amazing job assembling the team
-there is no clear cut decision still due job security and family issues to discuss
**** soft money model
currently have a hard money position so not familiar with such soft mondey model
in my field (env. exposure/spatial analysis) the grant money is much smaller, and opportunites are fewer. ₆In example₆ as we discussed NIEHS wont fund exposure modeling
what happens if in a specific year you don't have enough grants?
is there a grace period on the first few years?
- 3-5 years to reach 65%
- 65% of salary
- teaching brings 10-15 percent
- find hwork for michael, cant fire you.
- tenure- have to pay 55,000,
**** Im in the middle of tenure process
expect to get tenure close to the summer.
if we wait with this a year or two would that be better ( DON'T ASK THIS!---- feel bobs reaction about would it be possible to come with tenure)
in general whats the time frame for the hire?
maybe a sabatical as a bridge??
**** green card
whats the procedure, how fast can the green card process start?
**** academic duties 
- 150   
time to tenure and then:
-- what are you judged on: how many papers per year,where published, how many grants etc
- academic freedom- what am I expected to research, is there guidelines
- what are the department requirements?
- current collaboartions in israel and europe? what happens to that 
**** salary
whats the normal salary
benefits- yearly travel money, equipment benefits
pension when starting at age 40
**** teaching
does teaching cover some of the soft money?
**** laboratory 
-startup packages
