** Task
*** create yearly map for ALL years
*** create animation for a selected region (NYC?) for one year, daily file
*** Calculate R2

** paper
-new methods:
-we use now both Aqua and Terra (mit variable)
-we use mean temp (and also show results for min and max CV stage 1)
-present a correlation between aqua and terra perhaps?
-create a animation for a section (MA?) to show daily chnages in predictions
-same or ALT paper on urban heat islands
- maybe look at urban heat islandes and develop a threashold/index to define days with severe heat islands

** watch the BGU video from email
** talk to jennie
- does this need to be differnet from other grants i intend ot apply to  (young BSF,EHF,ISF):
The CIG and ISF can be the same

- how big is the scale for 4 years? prediction model for 1,2 counties, multiple pref models (pm+temp?), health outcomes?
Prepare a the main results and timtable and contact jenny via email
next week
** register
-i can register with harvard email
** writing it
focus on the Annexes (3+4?) in instruction (no need to read it all)
use electronic submission, register online and download the template and info from site

** what to include in that grant
- stress at onset that its prediction in past years not futire
- Focus on temperature model in italy
- stress the issues with climate change
- stress how our model is much better then central monitor sites since we show there is spatial heterogeneity
- show the new england-mia models which the italy model will be based on
- studies miss very hot/cold days in urban areas where there is 1 monitor for whole city (airport etc) which creates exposure erros.
- adaptation issues?
- Our models R2 (preformace) is much better then current LU regression
  models (E???)
** Important points
-compare the model to the ESCAPE LUR models

** my preparation
create 3 prediction dataset for one sample year 2008:
1 current model
1 predictions from a simple LU model
1 simple current model, that is minus LU terms that can be used in health studies

look at outcome- CVD in medicare
to see which LU are important use a poison regression of

#+begin_src R
counts ~ LU TERMS

*** What is the original paper in which you described the methodology of creating those datasets?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Kloog, I., A.A. Chudnovsky, A.C. Just, F. Nordio, P. Koutrakis, B.A. Coull, A. Lyapustin, Y. Wang, and J. Schwartz (2014). A new hybrid spatio-temporal model for estimating daily multi-year PM2.5 concentrations across northeastern USA using high resolution aerosol optical depth data Atmos. Env, 95, 581-590

*** Ways of comparing R-square, including how you “assign” AOD-derived estimation from regular grid points to monitoring site. I was looking for the nearest grid point for each monitoring site (I think this is the key difference). Is this the method you were using?

We also used the nearest AOD point per day to each monitor station. We used 2 techniques:
**** python method (old) 
Initially we used a GIS based method to subset the data into only data points within 1.5 km from a PM monitor station. Then we did daily spatial joins (using a python script) to assign in each day for each monitor the closest AOD point at that specific date. This resulted in a new database (per year) that looked like this:

| Date | PM_ID | PM25 | AOD | AOD_ID |
|    1 | x1    |   11 | 0.3 | y1     |
|    2 | x1    |   12 | 0.2 | y2     |
|      |       |      |     |        |
 
**** R KNN method
With the 1x1km data we switched to using a R function we created, see here:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
# function to assign closest
# merge data by day to the closest of K nearest neighbors (with a distance constraint)
# could be better (not require merge for left join afterwards)
# see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12450918
nearestbyday <- function(matrix1, matrix2, dt1, dt2, dt1varname, dt2varname, 
                         closestname = "closestmet", varstoget = "avewsp", 
                         knearest = 5, maxdistance = NA){
  require(FNN)
  knearest <- min(knearest, nrow(matrix2))
  knnname <- paste0(closestname, "knn")
  nobsname <- paste0(closestname, "nobs")
  # calculate nearest neighbors using package FNN
  knn_store <- get.knnx(matrix2, matrix1, k = knearest)
  # restrict by distance
  if(!is.na(maxdistance)){
    knn_store[["nn.dist"]][knn_store[["nn.dist"]] > maxdistance] <- NA
    knn_store[["nn.index"]] <- knn_store[["nn.index"]] * (knn_store[["nn.dist"]] * 0 + 1)
  }
  # store the indices for nearest neighbors in a long DT
  knn_out <- data.table(matrix(knn_store[["nn.index"]])) 
  knn_out[, dt1varname := rep(rownames(matrix1), knearest), with = F]
  knn_out[, closestname := as.character(row.names(matrix2[knn_out[, V1],])), with = F]
  knn_out[, V1 := NULL]
  knn_out[, knnname := rep(1:knearest, each = nrow(matrix1)), with = F]
  # drop points not within maxdistance
  knn_out <- knn_out[!is.na(get(closestname))]
  # use setkeyv to pass a column by name
  setkeyv(knn_out, closestname)
  setnames(dt2, dt2varname, closestname)
  # if not character - coerce
  if(class(dt2[,closestname,with = F][[1]]) != "character"){
    dt2[, closestname := as.character(closestname), with = F]
  }
  setkeyv(dt2, closestname)
  # lengthen dt2 with every possible site each day might match
  # after dropping missing observations
  dt2long <- dt2[!is.na(get(varstoget))][knn_out, allow.cartesian = T]
  # store the number of valid observations
  dt2long[, nobsname := .N, by=c(dt1varname,"day"), with = F]
  setkeyv(dt2long, cols = c(dt1varname, "day", knnname))
  # join to itself (set1 and day are keys) and take first record for fast selection
  closestvar <- dt2long[unique(dt2long[,c(dt1varname, "day"), with = F]), mult = "first"]
  gc()# clear memory
  # put the name back in dt2
  setnames(dt2, closestname, dt2varname)
  # inspect our result
  print(tables(silent = T)[NAME == "closestvar"])
  # return it silently
  invisible(closestvar)
}


makepointsmatrix <- function(datatable, xvar, yvar, idvar) {
  dtnames <- names(datatable)
  unique.dt <- unique(datatable[,c(xvar,yvar, idvar), with = F])
  out.m <- as.matrix(unique.dt[,c(xvar,yvar), with = F])
  dimnames(out.m)[[1]] <- unique.dt[,idvar, with = F][[1]]
  invisible(out.m)
}

#+END_SRC

we then use a script that goes through the days and assigns for each station in each day again the closet AOD point. 
here is the R script:

Let me know if its similar to your methods. If not and you would like to use one of the above methods i would be happy to help you set it up.

*** What is the way of using road density (they are raster file format with grid width maybe about 50 meters) did you interpolate raster values or just find the exact raster cell in which monitoring site lies. I guess the general question is---what is the general method of assigning value to each monitoring site if it is raster data file?
What we did was aggregate/disaggregate all LU/MET/Etc variables to the 1x1km Level from the study grid that we created based on the AOD data centroid. we used the Lat/Long to create the unique grid id (we call it guid in the scripts) and then calculate all the LU/MET terms for these 1x1km using several methods such as weighted averages for population density etc. specifacly if i recall for road density we create a raster of line density from the all lanes (A1,A2,A3) across MIA using in GIS:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
spatial analysit>density>Line density
#+END_EXAMPLE
This results in a Raster file with the "traffic density" (tden)

*** In your paper “Assessing temporally and spatially resolved PM2.5 exposures for epidemiological studies using satellite aerosol optical depth measurements”, you mentioned that you were finding the nearest weather station and assign meteorological data from that station to the monitoring site--- is this the same method you were using when creating 1-km estimation? 
yes that is the same methods we used in the last 1x1km paper. that data should also be on the server (NCDC and EPA met data)

** DONE VIIRS update
We made touch with VIIRS- meytar knows Rob levy
VIIRS is supposed to replace MODIS that is *scheduled* to go down in 2016
the data currently is in Beta stage
AOD data current base resolution is 6km (compared to MODIS base of 100/10km) ..will go down over time to 0.75 km 
we have very preliminary data we can get access today
VIIRS will have deep and blue dark target like algo. over both land and ocean
data range is 2012- current 
** DONE MAIAC Europe
a slight delay due to bugs they found
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Sorry for the delay. The process is delayed because we found some issues with the code, one is over partially snow covered area, another one is over some bright surface area.
Alexei is looking through this problem, so the process has to be hold to wait for the new updated code.

The issue about bright surface is: we need a threshold to decide when the algorithm go to bright surface mode. It seems this threshold is related to the location. For small area such as Israel, we can fix this number and get good retrieval, however, for large scale retrieval, we need find out how this threshold changes.  So the Israel subset is OK.

#+END_EXAMPLE


** DONE MAIAC Israel
currently PM10 cv is ~0.8 (0.87 NCV)

1. A paragraph on how the hybrid satellite model is an advancement on previous exposure methods:
Previous exposure methods have primarily used either assignment of exposure from central site monitors or parameterization of estimates based on land use regression (LUR) using spatial covariates. Individuals that live further from central site monitors may be assigned estimates with more error in this first approach which also does not account for spatial determinants of exposure such as living in an area with heavy traffic. Land use regression may better capture this spatial variability but typically doesn't include short term temporal variation. Error in assigning exposures can bias effect estimates (likely towards the null) and decrease the power to detect true associations. The hybrid satellite model uses the strengths of both exposure modeling approaches and adds in physical measurements of aerosol optical depth calibrated against the trusted ground monitoring network of central sites while accounting for local variability in spatial determinants of exposure such as roadway density.
 
2. A short statement on how we can collaborate with the geospatial institute:
Because vehicular emissions are a large contributor to PM2.5 concentrations, we will work with the Geospatial  Institute to develop measures of traffic that can serve as proxies for vehicular emissions to augment future iterations of the exposure model. In particular, metrics of roadway usage and fleet composition (e.g. diesel buses and trucks) that reflect historic and present patterns of traffic and that vary in both space and time are expected to improve on our currently implemented roadway density measures.
 
3. A summary of what GIS info/help we could use right away that can be forwarded to Martine?
We need some help with finding GIS data for political boundaries since we are currently building our models for an arbitrarily selected rectangular area. In particular, it would be very helpful to get a GIS shapefile delineating the boundaries of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (particularly if it clarified the boundaries of the DF vs included municipios from outlying areas like in the State of Mexico). Also, it would be great in the future to know the boundaries of the "megalopolis" and include the boundaries of the component states. 
 
We already have a shapefile with the AGEBs from the INEGI which has been joined to the 2010 census population counts so perhaps we are okay on that for now.
 
here is a quick paragraph on some epi methods for different kinds of health data.

Associations between air pollution and individual level health outcomes will be tested with generalized linear mixed models that account for the potential unexplained correlation of survey participants coming from the same census units. Count based (ecologic) data will be fit with negative binomial regression allowing for overdispersion and using a population offset. Models for dichotomous outcomes will be fit using relative risk regression with modified poisson links in order to estimate risk ratios rather than odds ratios and to avoid apparent interaction in the odds ratio that can be due to differences in outcome prevalence between socioeconomic strata. Interaction will be assessed as departure from additivity and thus, in multiplicative models will be assessed using the relative excess risk due to interaction. Potential confounders will be derived from previous literature on the health impacts of air pollution and considered for inclusion after the construction of directed acyclic graphs. ### PUT SOME EXAMPLES HERE - PERHAPS I WOULD CONSIDER SEASON AND LONG TERM TIME TREND IN ADDITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS LIKE SEX AGE EDUCATION AND SMOKING DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU HAVE ###


I would also consider the hypothesis that social context is important and that individual SES responses on the health survey could be augmented with census based SES about the neighborhood and accommodated in this mixed model framework - for example, is it the same thing to be poor in a wealthy neighborhood than it is to be of lower means but similar to everyone around you? That could be another area where you work with the geospatial institute to derive neighborhood metrics.

for euro we can get uk and swiss data

*** lit review 
perliminary lit review on OSM use in environmental health resulted in little to no studies
there are some stuides using OSM as data sources in public health in general but no comparios or quantative examples on OSM vs traditinal traffic/road use data
however there are many studies looking at OSM and OSM use in studies in terms of valididty, accuracy coverage etc:

http://koenigstuhl.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/publications/2010/Zielstra/AGILE2010_Zielstra_Zipf_final5.pdf

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_and_OSL_differences_analysis

*** our focus
should be on:
- OSM use as a valid and readly avilable data/exposure source in envrinonmental health 
- sepcifically in underdevloped areas such as africa/etc where traditional road data isn't avilable

*** study
show how well OSM and Euro tden data correlates over "good" coverage areas such as swiss?
compare then how they work in "bad" areas such as africa?
comparisons: 

- [ ] subtracting OpenStreetMap data from tden data?
- [ ] create line density maps- Calculates a magnitude per unit area from polyline features
create suraces and look at correlation 
- [ ] compare road type classifications 

health outcomes available:

- [ ] access to health care centers based on roads?

משרד המדע: תשתיות מדעיות בתחום החלל – קול קורא להצעות מחקר (מועד ההגשה לרשות המחקר 10.5, למשרד המדע: 14.5)
http://most.gov.il/Information/Calls/Pages/Space2015.aspx

aims:

use of sattelite data for improving predicting air pollution 
management of environmental resources speciffacly air pollution

use of deep blue over ocean for better use of aod 

A1: data fusion and calman
fusion CMAQ VIIRS deep blue
A2: methods improvments
use of moving windows to asses daily aod quality at each point
better use of higher resolution tmeporal met variables using WRF data integration
combining aqua and terra
space-time smoothing; nearby cells weighted for missing and previous day (if gone, use today)
does relationship of Aqua and Terra give us info? early pollutant build-up vs continuous across the day?

** EHP response

Comment on “Using Satellite-Based Resolved Air Temperature Exposure to Study the Association between Ambient Air Temperature and Birth Outcomes in Massachusetts” 

In a recently published paper using space-time satellite data to determine air temperature (Ta), Kloog et al. conclude that “Ta during pregnancy was associated with lower birth weight and shorter gestational age in our study population.” The results obtained pointed to associations between Ta and birth weight during the last trimester and Ta and preterm delivery and low birth weight during the entire pregnancy. These results are in agreement with those obtained by Dadvand et al. (2014) whereby Ta has a stressful role influencing low birth weight. 
There are many epidemiological studies reporting a nonlinear J- or U-shaped relationship between Ta and health indicators such as mortality (Basu and Samet 2002) and morbidity (Ye et al. 2012), with different response times for heat and cold waves (Gasparrini et al. 2015). When Kloog et al. performed linear and logistic models, Ta is introduced with a linear component in multiple time windows before birth. Models also were adjusted for different environmental and sociodemographic factors. However, the authors did not control for heat and cold episodes during pregnancy. From our point of view, a similar nonlinear behavior could be expected or would at least be worth analyzing in the case of adverse birth variables. As a susceptible population group, pregnant women may be more sensitive to changes in temperature and may be at a greater risk of heat stress, because during pregnancy the increase in fat deposition and associated decrease in the ratio of body surface area to body mass result in less capacity for heat loss to the environment (Wells and Cole 2002).
A study conducted in Rome with time series analysis methodology (Schifano et al. 2013) showed that heat, as measured by the maximum temperature in warmer periods, was associated in the short term with preterm birth. This apparent effect of temperature was not observed in the cold periods. Similar results were obtained in Madrid (Linares et al. 2015). This study considered daily maximum temperatures above 34°C (the definition of a heat wave for Madrid) and below –2°C, corresponding to the minimum daily temperature (the definition of a cold wave for Madrid) for the period 2001–2009. The results obtained about the influence of high temperatures on the low birth weight were similar to those found in Rome, with the same short-term association between temperature rise and increase in cases of premature birth and, consequently, low birth weight.
This suggests heat waves are an acute stressor on pregnant women, and not the chronic stressor described by Kloog et al. The mechanism is unclear by which high temperatures may increase the risk of preterm birth, but there is evidence in the literature that relation them at the short-term (Carolan-Olah and Frankowska 2014). This short-term effect of Ta on adverse birth outcomes is similar to that already described for traffic noise as a factor in adverse birth outcomes in Madrid (Diaz and Linares 2015). 
Although Kloog et al. introduced Ta values with linear components, from our point of view, introducing Ta as a linear component and not taking into account the effects of heat and cold separately minimizes the determination of the impacts. The effects of high temperatures may be offset by cold temperatures. Therefore, it would be interesting to improve the analysis of Kloog et al. taking into account the effect of Ta, but separating its effect by warm and cold seasons and especially on days of heat wave and cold wave periods.

Comment on “Using Satellite-Based Resolved Air Temperature Exposure to Study the Association between Ambient Air Temperature and Birth Outcomes in Massachusetts” 

In a recently published paper using space-time satellite data to determine air temperature (Ta), Kloog et al. conclude that “Ta during pregnancy was associated with lower birth weight and shorter gestational age in our study population.” The results obtained pointed to associations between Ta and birth weight during the last trimester and Ta and preterm delivery and low birth weight during the entire pregnancy. These results are in agreement with those obtained by Dadvand et al. (2014) whereby Ta has a stressful role influencing low birth weight. 
There are many epidemiological studies reporting a nonlinear J- or U-shaped relationship between Ta and health indicators such as mortality (Basu and Samet 2002) and morbidity (Ye et al. 2012), with different response times for heat and cold waves (Gasparrini et al. 2015). When Kloog et al. performed linear and logistic models, Ta is introduced with a linear component in multiple time windows before birth. Models also were adjusted for different environmental and sociodemographic factors. However, the authors did not control for heat and cold episodes during pregnancy. From our point of view, a similar nonlinear behavior could be expected or would at least be worth analyzing in the case of adverse birth variables. As a susceptible population group, pregnant women may be more sensitive to changes in temperature and may be at a greater risk of heat stress, because during pregnancy the increase in fat deposition and associated decrease in the ratio of body surface area to body mass result in less capacity for heat loss to the environment (Wells and Cole 2002).

This apparent effect of temperature was not observed in the cold periods. Similar results were obtained in Madrid (Linares et al. 2015).

-plot 2: box plot of true pm and pm 10km vs 1km per ( and maybe 200) city and by season
range of true PM, pred 10, pred 1-check ranges in each 
-plot 3: distances from main roads and/or urban rings and levels of PM: take NYC and boston and see how much the levels of pm go down for each few km's from the city: downtown, surrondings area, outer core , rural
-plot 4: transported pm by trajectories and thresholds
-discussion: show how you might underestimate the health effect (exposure bias)
maiac is similar to modis but much more obsrv with more variability


comparing rural vs urban areas, comparing cities by decreasing populations

if there are enough monitors examine the spatial variability, temporal correlations among stations, examine common(?) geo-climatic patters, topography, land cover, ...
Use correlation between nearby stations as a spatial variable
!no! I do not think this belongs to phase 1. Maybe to phase 2??? When you apply the model and have only aod how whould you apply this term? I think it is the same cheating as using random intercept that accounts for the AQM station. If there are links between stations ayo ushould see them via the above (previous item).
