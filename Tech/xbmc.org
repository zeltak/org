 Examples for User-Defined Thumbnails:
 Single Video File
 The following example "videofilename.avi" will now use the thumbnail
"videofilename.tbn".
 Videos\path\videofilename.tbn
 Videos\path\videofilename.avi
 TV Show Season Thumbnail
 In the following example, the thumbnail will be used for the
appropriate season in the Video Library season node. Where xx is 01, 02
etc.
 TV\showfolder\seasonxx.tbn
 Multi Part (Stacked) Movie Files
 You can either use the filename of the first file in the stack or the
name of the stack, so for:
 Movies\path\moviename-CD1.avi
 Movies\path\moviename-CD2.avi
 Either of the below would work:
 Movies\path\moviename-CD1.tbn
 Movies\path\moviename.tbn
 The same goes for playlists, and internet-stream files, example:
 Playlists\path\videoplaylistname.pls
 Playlists\path\videoplaylistname.tbn
 Streams\path\videostreamname.strm
 Streams\path\videostreamname.tbn
 Thumnails and folder icons info - XBMC Wiki
 Thumbnailing Individual Items in a Single Directory
 Name the icon file the same as the file you would like it to display
for with a .tbn extension ie: Transformers.avi, Transformers.tbn. This
is particularly useful for using custom thumbnails for movies.
 Example:
 Movies\path\moviename.avi
 Movies\path\moviename.tbn
 Folder Thumbnails
 If you store each of your media files in separate subfolders to keep
things organized, you can also make the folder have a custom thumbnail
image. To do this you eiter need to save your JPG/PNG thumbnail as
folder.jpg and place it inside your movie/album folder, or you can save
it as <foldername>.tbn and place it at the same level as the folder in
the directory tree.
 * Remember, XBMC first checks for <foldername>.tbn before checking
for folder.jpg.
 * Some documentation suggests that folder.tbn can be used. In
general folder.jpg is superior as it is detected during a scan i.e. XBMC
will correctly use folder.jpg but not folder.tbn.
 * Note that folder.jpg MUST be named .jpg, even if it is a .png
format image.
 Examples:
 Movies\path\foldername\
 Movies\path\foldername.tbn
 or
 Movies\path\moviename\folder.jpg
 Music\path\album\folder.jpg
 Now your media folder will have a lovely custom thumbnail-image.
 You can via advancedsettings.xml change the default filename of the
image that XBMC uses for music folders. See the <musicthumbs> tag. for
more information.
 
 Program Thumbnails
 In order to display the image displayed for a game, emulator or
application, simply rename the desired image default.tbn and place it in
the folder where the corresponding default.XBE is located.
 Music Thumbnails
 Music Thumbnails are assigned as part of a multitier process. First,
the Tag Reader runs and caches any embedded art using the album name and
album artist (or song artist, if that is all that is available). If the
album name or artist is unavailable, it is cached using the path name of
the song. This assumes, of course, that you have tag reading enabled.
 You can also use "Get Thumb" to download the album thumbnail from
allmusic.com (AMG) for a specific album/folder or do a scan of all your
music files in all shares.
 Thumbnails also get downloaded when you rip AudioCD's to your XBox with
XBMC (which is described in the Ripping CDs section).
 Recomended is that you store each of your music-albums or artists in a
separate subfolder to keep things organized. You can also of course make
the folder have a custom thumbnail image.
 
 Notes: Running a scan automatically enables 'tag reading' so
everything can be cached. Once a scan is run, all your files and their
associated thumbnails are stored in the database.
 The Album Information dialog (available from the context menu) will
allow you to choose between the cover art available for download from
allmusic.com and any user-defined thumbnail you may have.
 Press the "Get Thumb" button to bring up a choice of the local
thumbnails you have, the currently assigned thumbnail and the
allmusic.com thumbnail.
 The code which assigns thumbnails to files runs and assigns thumbnails
in the following order:
 1) Cached Album Thumbnail
 This is all the embedded album art read by the tag reader and
cached using the album name and album artist.
 2) Cached filename.tbn
 This includes an embedded thumbnail cached with the fully qualified
name.
 3) Remote filename.tbn
 This is a filename.tbn on a remote share/folder which is then
cached.
 4) Cached folder.jpg
 This is a folder.jpg which is cached based off the folder path.
 5) Remote folder.jpg
 This is a folder.jpg on a remote share/folder which is then cached.
 6) Remote foldername.tbn
 This is a foldername.tbn on a remote share/folder which is then
cached.
 Examples:
 In this example audiofilename.mp3 will use audiofilename.tbn as
thumbnail:
 Music\path\audiofilename.mp3
 Music\path\audiofilename.tbn
 The same goes for playlists, cue-sheets, SHOUTcast, and internet-stream
files, example:
 Music\path\audioplaylistname.m3u
 Music\path\audioplaylistname.tbn
 Music\path\cuelistname.cue
 Music\path\cuelistname.mp3
 Music\path\cuelistname.tbn
 Music\path\shoutcastlinkname.pls
 Music\path\shoutcastlinkname.tbn
 Music\path\audiostreamname.strm
 Music\path\audiostreamname.tbn
 Video Thumbnails
 You can either use your own custom thumbnails or XBMC can retreive
video thumbnails from the internet via scrapers and cache them.
 XBMC applies thumbnails to video files in the following order:
 1) Cached Thumbnail
 Thumbnails are cached to UserData\Thumbnails\Video using the CRC of
the path of the file or folder.
 2) User-Defined Thumbnail
 For files: XBMC checks for <filename>.tbn and uses that if it
exists.The thumbnail is cached the first time it is read.
 For movies, movie.tbn will override any other thumb.
 For folders: XBMC first checks for <foldername>.tbn in the same
directory as the folder is in. If no <foldername>.tbn exists XBMC then
checks for folder.jpg inside the movie-folder. In either case the first
found thumb of those is cached.
 
 Examples for User-Defined Thumbnails
 Single Video File
 The following example "videofilename.avi" will now use the thumbnail
"videofilename.tbn".
 Videos\path\videofilename.tbn
 Videos\path\videofilename.avi
 Multi Part (Stacked) Video Files
 You can either use the filename of the first file in the stack or the
name of the stack, so for:
 Movies\path\moviename-CD1.avi
 Movies\path\moviename-CD2.avi
 Either of the below would work:
 Movies\path\moviename-CD1.tbn
 Movies\path\moviename.tbn
 Movie
 If content has been set to Movies, movie.tbn will override any other
thumbs for media in that folder. In he following example
"videofilename.avi" will now use the thumbnail "movie.tbn".
 Videos\path\movie.tbn
 Videos\path\videofilename.avi
 TV Show Season Thumbnails
 In the following example, the thumbnail will be used for the
appropriate season in the Video Library season node. Where xx is 01, 02
etc.
 TV\showfolder\seasonxx.tbn
 For specials:
 TV\showfolder\season-specials.tbn
 For the all seasons item:
 TV\showfolder\season-all.tbn
 Playlist and internet-stream file examples:
 Playlists\path\videoplaylistname.pls
 Playlists\path\videoplaylistname.tbn
 Streams\path\videostreamname.strm
 Streams\path\videostreamname.tbn
 Picture Thumbnails
 XBMC applies thumbnails to picture files in the following order:
 1) Cached Thumbnail
 Thumbnails are cached to UserData\Thumbnails\Pictures using the CRC
of the path of the file or folder.
 2) Images
 EXIF thumbnail in JPEG images are then read. If no EXIF thumbnail
is available, XBMC will load the image and generate a thumbnail from the
image. These are then cached.
 3) Folders
 <MyHolidayPictures>\folder.jpg is checked first. If that file
doesn't exist, XBMC will generate a thumbnail from up to 4 random images
inside that folder.
 Thumbnails for Sources
 You can change the thumbnail displayed for a source by editing
UserData\sources.xml.
 Note: Source thumbnails have to be in a folder on the local Xbox
harddrive!
 Simply modify your source as shown:
 
 <source>
 <name>Music</name>
 <path>xbms://192.168.1.100:1400/Music/</path>
 <thumbnail>F:\Apps\XBMC\thumbs\shares\thumb.png</thumbnail>
 </source>
 Auto Switch to Icon Mode
 XBMC tries to automatically switch to Large Icon view when the View
Mode is set to Auto in the Settings. It first checks if the skin has
Large Icon view, failing that switches to Icon view. If neither is
available it goes for List View.
 The rules are as follows:
 Programs
 Auto switches to Icon view when 50% of all the items (files and folder)
have thumbs.
 Pictures
 Auto switches to Thumbs view when the list contains more than 25%
files. (In the case of Pictures, all items have thumbs as they are
generated upon entering the folder.)
 Videos
 Auto switches to Thumb view when 50% of all the items (files and
folder) have thumbs.
 Music
 Auto switches to Thumb view when the list contains at least 75% folders
and at least 50% of them have thumbs. (Remember that playlist files like
m3u, pls, etc, are treated as folders by default)
 Hashing
 The thumbnail .tbn file is created via a hashing function. As explained
earlier, the hash is based off the CRC32 of the pathname (plus filename)
in lowercase. Files which are local are hashed using their drive letter.
Remote files are hashed using the smb:// protocol designation and
optional username and password.
 Examples
 * 123456789 returns 0376e6e7
 * F:\Videos\Nosferatu.avi returns 2a6ec78d
 * smb://user:pass@server/share/directory/ returns c5559f13
 * smb://user:pass@server/share/directory/file.ext returns 8ce36055
 Remember:
 * When hashing remote shares, use the path as displayed in the
sources.xml file, which can include the username and password.
 * When hashing directories for thumbnails, include the final slash.
 Sample Code
 The following code is written in C# and produces the same output as the
XBMC hashing function.
 public string Hash(string input)
 {
 uint m\_crc = 0xffffffff;
 System.Text.ASCIIEncoding encoding = new
System.Text.ASCIIEncoding();
 bytes = encoding.GetBytes(input.ToLower());
 foreach (byte myByte in bytes)
 {
 m\_crc \^= ((uint)(myByte) << 24);
 for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
 {
 if ((System.Convert.ToUInt32(m\_crc) & 0x80000000) ==
0x80000000)
 {
 m\_crc = (m\_crc << 1) \^ 0x04C11DB7;
 }
 else
 {
 m\_crc <<= 1;
 }
 }
 }
 return String.Format("{0:x8}", m\_crc);

 *advancedsettings.xml - XBMC Wiki
*
 The "advancedsettings.xml" file, which does not exist by default, may
be created by a user in their "\UserData\" folder.
 Please consult your plaform specific FAQ for the appropriate location.
 This file can contain additional settings and pre-defined values for
the settings available in the GUI (thus removing them from the GUI
settings screens).
 "advancedsettings.xml" is useful for advanced/expert users and for
installers.
 NOTE! This file will not exist unless created by the end-user,
meaning YOU!
 The XBMC software will never write to this file, so any settings you
define will not be overwritten by any XBMC GUI settings.
 So you can only edit this file manually on your computer, via a
text-editor (like Notepad in Windows or a XML-editor).
 All the settings available outside of the GUI are documented on this
page.
 NOTE: This file is CaSe SeNsItIvE and must contain the
<advancedsettings> tag (see the layout section below), so make sure you
use all lower-case tags or they will not be read properly by XBMC.

 </samba>
 <moviestacking>
 This tag used to be called <videostacking>.
 Contains "Regular Expression" syntax (commonly refered to as "RegEx" or
"RegExp") for use in matching filenames in a "stack" of video files. The
regular expression must have a (...) surrounding the volume label
portion. Text matching is compared case-insensitive. Anything matched by
the regular expression will be removed from the titlename. If more than
one (...) section is used, the first one will be the prefix, the second
one the volume label, and the third one (if it exists) will be the
suffix. Use this to keep extensions after matching. If more than one
expression matches a particular filename, the first one will be used.
 Default stacking:
 
 <moviestacking>
 <regexp>[ \_\.-]+cd[ \_\.-]*([0-9a-d]+)</regexp>
 <regexp>[ \_\.-]+dvd[ \_\.-]*([0-9a-d]+)</regexp>
 <regexp>[ \_\.-]+part[ \_\.-]*([0-9a-d]+)</regexp>
 <regexp>[ \_\.-]+dis[ck][ \_\.-]*([0-9a-d]+)</regexp>
 <regexp>()[ \_\.-]+([0-9]*[abcd]+)(\.....?)$</regexp>
 <regexp>([a-z])([0-9]+)(\.....?)$</regexp>
 <regexp>()([ab])(\.....?)$</regexp>
 </moviestacking>
 If the argument action="append" or append="yes" is supplied, the
default videostacking regular expressions will remain intact and the
user specified ones will be added to the end. Example:
 
 <moviestacking action="append">
 <regexp>custom[ \_\.-]*([0-9a-d]+)</regexp>
 </moviestacking>
 If the argument action="prepend" is supplied, the default videostacking
regular expressions will remain intact and the user specified ones will
be added to the beginning. Example:
 
 <moviestacking action="prepend">
 <regexp>custom[ \_\.-]*([0-9a-d]+)</regexp>
 </moviestacking>
 If no argument is supplied, or the argument append="no" is supplied,
the default videostacking regular expressions are overwritten by the
user specified ones.
 <tvshowmatching>
 Contains "Regular Expression" syntax (commonly refered to as "RegEx" or
"RegExp") to match the season and episode numbers in filenames. Text
matching is compared case-insensitive.
 Default stacking:
 
 <tvshowmatching>
 <regexp>\[[Ss]([0-9]+)\]\_\[[Ee]([0-9]+)([\^\\/]*)</regexp> <!--
foo\_[s01]\_[e01] -->
 <regexp>[\.\_ \-]([0-9]+)x([0-9]+)([\^\\/]*)</regexp> <!-- foo.1x09
-->
 <regexp>[\.\_ \-][Ss]([0-9]+)[\.\-]?[Ee]([0-9]+)([\^\\/]*)</regexp>
<!-- foo, s01e01, foo.s01.e01, foo.s01-e01 -->
 <regexp>[\.\_ \-]([0-9]+)([0-9][0-9])([\.\_ \-][\^\\/]*)</regexp>
<!-- foo.103 -->
 </tvshowmatching>
 The "append" and "action" arguments described in the videostacking
section work the same for tvshowmatching tags. Examples of matching
regexps for certain filenames can be found on the TV\_Shows page.
 NOTE: for multi-episode matching to work, there needs to be a third set
of parentheses on the end. This part is fed back into the regexp engine.
 <excludefromscan/excludefromlisting>
 Contains regular expressions to match filenames or folders which should
be excluded from a library scan. This can be for both Video or Audio
sections of advancedsettings.xml.
 Default excludes:
 
 <video>
 <excludefromscan>
 <regexp>[-\.\_ ](sample|trailer)[-\.\_ ]</regexp>
 </excludefromscan>
 </video>
 The "append" and "action" arguments described in the videostacking
section work the same for excludefromscan tags.
 <pathsubstitution>
 Path substitutions for use with playlist loading. These are processed
in order, and are useful for substituting an absolute path on a PC with
a path suitable for XBMC to handle. Default is no path substitutions
defined. An example is:
 
 <pathsubstitution>
 <substitute>
 <from>G:\dvds\</from>
 <to>smb://somecomputer/g-share/dvds/</to>
 </substitute>
 </pathsubstitution>
 <forcedswaptime>
 Use to force a backbuffer->frontbuffer swap while vsync is enabled. Set
to the time (in ms) to allow for the swap (eg
<forcedswaptime>1</forcedswaptime> is typical). It defaults off.
 <playlistasfolders>
 In the recent releases, playlists are treated as folders. Selecting a
playlist no longer plays it, but opens it, as if it were a folder.
 Set to false to revert to the previous behavior. When you select a
playlist, its content is added to the list of elements to be played.
 NOTE! This setting will not affect smart playlists, they will always
show as folders.
 <playlistretries>
 The default number of retries if for example a source is offline is
100. With this control you can alter the number of consecutive failed
items before a playlist fails.
 
 <playlistretries>100</playlistretries>
 <playlisttimeout>
 The default timeout before item failure is 20 sec. It can be changed
with this control
 
 <playlisttimeout>20</playlisttimeout>
 <songinfoduration>
 This controls how long the song information will remain onscreen when
the song changes during visualisations. The valid range is 1 to 15, in
seconds. This does not include the duration of any transition effects.
(The default is 2 seconds.)
 
 <songinfoduration>10</songinfoduration>
 <remoterepeat>
 The repeat delay for the Infrared remote control, in milliseconds.
Length of time a remote button needs to be held before it will start
repeating (ie continuously sending button pushes while it's held down).
Defaults to 480.
 <controllerdeadzone>
 Deadzone for controller thumb sticks. 0 indicates no deadzone at all. 1
indicates all deadzone (ie no movement will be detected). Defaults to
0.2
 <displayremotecodes>
 Set to true to have XBMC display the Infrared Remote's button codes
(OBC's) on screen when you press buttons. Useful for assigning functions
to the buttons on a universal remote control. Defaults to false. Affects
only XBox.
 <thumbsize>
 Size of the square in pixels that XBMC will use to cache thumbnail
images. If the thumb is smaller than this size it will be cached as-is.
If it is larger it will be scaled so that the number of pixels is less
than a square of this value. Default is 512 (192 on xbox), which refers
to 512x512 = 262144 (for XBox 192x192 = 36864) pixels in total. The
thumbnail will be cached at using the same aspect ratio as the original
image, using up to 262144 (for XBox 36864) pixels.
 <musicthumbs>
 A list of additional files to try when searching for music thumbnail
images. (The default is folder.jpg which can be removed.)
 
 <musicthumbs>
 <remove>folder.jpg</remove>
 <add>thumb.jpg|cover.jpg</add>
 </musicthumbs>
 <musicfilenamefilters>
 Contains filters to match music information (artist, title etc.) from a
tagless music filename. The first <filter> to match completely is used.
Matched items include:
 %A - Artist %T - Title %B - Album %N - Track number %S - Part of set
(disk number) %D - Duration %G - Genre %Y - Year %R - Rating
 
 <musicfilenamefilters>
 <filter>%A - %T</filter>
 </musicfilenamefilters>
 <dvdthumbs>
 A list of additional files to try when searching for dvdrom thumbnail
images. (The default is folder.jpg which can be removed.)
 
 <dvdthumbs>
 <remove>folder.jpg</remove>
 <add>thumb.jpg|cover.jpg</add>
 </dvdthumbs>
 <masterlock>
 If you enable any masterlock settings below, they will be removed from
UI. Code needs to be MD5'd, and you can use this site to hash it.
 
 
 <masterlock>
 <startuplock>false</startuplock> <!-- true prompts user for code
upon startup -->
 <enableshutdown>false</enableshutdown> <!-- true shuts down xbox
after 3 failed attempts to enter correct code -->
 <automastermode>false</automastermode> <!-- automatically enters

screen or not -->
 <!-- advancedsettings.xml ONLY: -->
 <maxretries>3<maxretries> <!-- enter the max number of retries to

 </masterlock>
 <postprocessing>
 MPlayer postprocessing settings. This is unreliable, and so they're in
here only.
 
 <postprocessing>
 <enable>false</enable> <!-- enable/disable postprocessing -->
 <auto>true</auto> <!-- auto filter settings (overrides the below)

 How to include GUI settings
 You can also define the settings normally defined in the GUI in
advancedsettings.xml. Any GUI based settings defined in
advancedsettings.xml will override the GUI values, and the settings will
be removed completely from the GUI (ie only alterable by editting
advancedsettings.xml).
 The easiest way to include a GUI setting is to first make sure it is
set in the GUI to the value that you want, and then to open the
UserData\guisettings.xml file and find the XML entry that corresponds to
that setting.
 Then just add that entry to the advancedsettings.xml file.
 For instance, to set the Font Character Set for the GUI (found in the
appearance setting, in the Look and Feel section), you'd open up
guisettings.xml and find:
 
 <lookandfeel>
 <charset>Hebrew (Windows)</charset>
 </lookandfeel>
 Simply take that entry and place it in advancedsettings.xml. The GUI
entry for the character set will then no longer appear, and XBMC will
always use the Hebrew (Windows) character set.
 Here are some special cases, if they aren't defined the user will be
prompted first time he/she tries to access any of these paths:
 Note: There are no default pre-set values

*** basic remote setup

*Edit, Change and make sense of XBMC lirc/keymap : Zeltaks guide*
 1. the way it works is that you need to create or better copy from
*/usr/share/xmbc/system*
 the files remote.xml to */home/zeltak/.xbmc/usrdata/keymaps
*
 and
 lircmap.xml to */home/zeltak/.xbmc/usrdata/
*
 2.after installing lirc:
 -use irw from the CLI to get the remote irw names and codes
 Or look at
 */etc/lirc/lircd.conf*
 to see the key names
 example output:
 zeltak@ztpc:~$ irw
 00000000000017bb 00 Go Hauppauge\_350
 00000000000017bd 00 Power Hauppauge\_350
 000000000000179c 00 TV Hauppauge\_350
 3. edit the file Lircmap.xml :
 -make sure remote name fits the one you got in irw (Hauppauge\_350 in
this case) and that the name inside brackets fits the name in the irw
output ("TV" in this example<mytv>TV</mytv>)
 example:
 <lircmap>
 <remote device="Hauppauge\_350">
 <pause>Pause</pause>
 <stop>Stop</stop>
 <forward>Forward</forward>
 <reverse>Rewind</reverse>
 <left>Left</left>

 <seven>7</seven>
 <eight>8</eight>
 <nine>9</nine>
 <zero>0</zero>
 <star>Asterix</star>
 <hash>Blue</hash>
 </remote>
 3. edit the remote.xml (prev keymap.xml) file:
 Since XBMC DHARMA the location of the Keymap.xml file changed. It is
now named remote.xml and can be found in:
 *$HOME/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/remote.xml*
 look for the remote section and edit the outside brackets to fit the
lircmap file (button names can be found at

[[http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=Keymap.xml][http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=Keymap.xml]]
 and here

[[http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?t=45972][http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?t=45972]]
 use only button names that are in the link under universal remote (IE
<star> etc...) , own names will not work!!
 b. modify the inside bracket to whatever xbmc command you want (see
[[http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Window_IDs][http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Window\_IDs]])
 example:
 <keymap>

** scripts

*start xbmc from script
*
 use the backup script or create new script with this inside
 #!/bin/bash

 if [ "$PROCESS" = "" ]
 then
 rm -f /home/xbmc/core*
 DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/xbmc &

 prog = irexec
 button = Blue
 repeat = 4
 config = /home/zeltak/Scripts/xbmc.sh
 end*make sure Irexec is UP and runing
*
 create a script in /usr/bin/ and paste this
 #!/bin/sh
 while true; do
 irexec
 sleep 5
 done
 Make sure the script is executable and owned by zeltak with
permissions.
 Add it to the autostart folder and in addition nake sure irxevent and
irexec also autostart at bootup

** mythtv integration

*Add MythTV as a Video Source*
 0.add ip adress of mythserver (ztpc) to host list and then add
hostname instead of ip
 1. Once XBMC is installed and running on your Xbox go to "Videos"
and select "Add Source"
 2. In the "Enter the paths or browse for the media locations." field
you will need to enter the properly formatted username, password, and IP
information for your mythconverg database. This information should be
prefixed with "myth://" and follow standard linux network access
formatting of: "username:password@ipaddress". For example, if your
mythconverg database is located on a machine whose ip address is
192.168.1.116 and uses the username "mythtv" and the password "password"
you should enter the following:
 myth://mythtv:<pwd>@localhost (myth://mythtv:<pwd>@<ip>)
 user (mythtv) = mysql username from mysql.txt
 pass = pass from mysql.txt.
 Examples
 myth://mythtv:password@192.168.1.116
 or
 myth://mythtv:password@ztpc
 3. Input a name for this source in the "Enter a name for this Media
Source" field. This name is what will appear in the "Videos" list of
XBMC.
 4. Click on "OK" to add this source to the "Videos" list.

*How to create custom nfo's
*
 name movie files S01E01-filename1, S01E02-filename2, etc. and put them
into a folder.
 Then run Yang to generate the movie nfo files (nfo files with the same
exact name of the movie file).
 After Yang creates the nfo files edit them with Notepad
 then create the tvshow.nfo file in a text editor and drop it into the
folder of the above movies.*tv show example-XBMC wiki
*
 he filename of the NFO should be "tvshow.nfo" (Exact, NOT the name of
the actual TV show) and it should be in the root folder of the TV show.
 The nfo xml file may contain a valid <episodeguideurl> to allow online
updates. If not, only episodes with nfo files will be added.

case of multi-part (stacked) video stacking, name the file either
moviename.nfo or moviename-CD1.nfo where the first filename is

** offline/deleted media

*** create 'stub' files to represent offline/deleted media

media stub files represent media outside of the online digital
infrastructure and allow XBMC's library to catalogue your "offline"
media collection, as well as ask for the media when selected for
playback.
 By default these files have a .disc extension (modifiable via
advancedsettings.xml).
 In cooperation with Confluence Skin's (and possibly others) feature to
search for words like DVD, Bluray, and HDDVD in the filename it is
possible to create a disc stub file that will show correct media flags
in the skin.
 For example, if you have Finding Nemo on DVD, you could create an empty
file called:
 "Finding Nemo (2003).dvd.disc"
 and add it to your library. In the XBMC libray this file will show up
with the DVD media flag in the Confluence Skin and when selected you
will be prompted to insert the Finding Nemo DVD.
 To mark a disc stub as BluRay add the words "bluray" or "bdrip" to the
file name (as explained above). For HDDVD add "hddvd". For DVD add
"dvd". For TV add "pdtv", "hdtv", or "dsr". For VHS add "vhs".
 XBMC now has support for adding a custom message to be displayed when
attempting to play a Disc Stub file. This is accomplished by treating
the disc stub file as an xml file with the following layout:
 <discstub>
 <message>Message to be displayed</message>
 </discstub>
 The message will be displayed on the second line of the dialog box that
asks you to insert a disc when selecting a disc stub file for playback.
This added feature allows users who use a numbered library for their
disc media to also take advantage of this new Disc Stub file support in
XBMC.
 example of a file stub name:
 transformers.dvd.disc

*** batch create stub files from list

[[xbmc_files/attach/deleted_stub.dvd.disc][Attachment #01
(deleted\_stub.dvd.disc)]]
 use this command:
 *cat LISTFILE.txt| while read name; do cp deleted\_stub.dvd.disc
"$name.dvd.disc"; done
 NOTE: you can find the stub template attached*

** Dl2XBMC process

*** 1.move DL files to proccessing Dir

after the file has been Downloaded to the P2P folder, move each files
based on type to the processing folder:
 /media/raid/thd/$tools/xbmc\_prep/
 and the subfolder: movies, TV, music. Comic

*** 2.clean DL files from crap

use the following command on the folder of choice:
 *
*find . '(' -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.tbn' -o -iname '*.jpeg' -o
-iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.rar' -o -iname '*.srt' -o -iname '*.txt' -o
-iname '*.nfo' -o -iname '*.url' -o -iname '*.pdf' -o -iname '*.m3u' -o
-iname '*.db' -o -iname '*.html' -o -iname '*.cue' -o -iname '*.log' -o
-iname '*.txt' -o -iname '*.ffp' -o -iname '*.htm' -o -iname '*.md5' -o
-iname '*.gif' -o -iname '*.torrent' -o -iname '*.log' -o -iname '*.tmp'
-o -iname '*.folder' -o -iname '*.doc'-o -iname '*.mood' -o -iname
'*.JPEG' ')' -exec rm {} \;
 this will get rid of all files but the media files

*** 3.use 'the renamer' under Win VM

open a VM (the 'XXXx' VM)
 use the 'The renamer' app to rename movies and move them to own folder

*** 3a.create folders for files

if not using the renamer (step 2) then do it manually
 first create a text files from the files needed:
 ls >> filelist.txt
 use the following command:
 create dirs from a a files text
 cat k.txt |while read i; do mkdir "$i"; done *make sure to del *.avi
from text file if exists before issuing the command*

*** move a bunch of .avi into corresponding dirs

move a bunch of .avi into corresponding dirs
 for f in *; do mv "$f" /somewhere/else/"$f"/; done
 Note: the dirs need to be name DIRNAME.avi

*** create dirs from a a files text

create dirs from a a files text
 cat k.txt |while read i; do mkdir "$i"; done
 make sure to del *.avi from text file if exists before issuing the
command

*** move files from one folder to another based on file type

*Move files from one folder to another based on file type
*
 in this example we are moving all media files:
 find /media/mova/ '(' -iname '*.avi' -o -iname '*.mpeg' -o -iname
'*.divx' -o -iname '*.ogm' ')' -exec mv {} /media/movt \;

* openelec
** ssh root
user: root
pass:openelec

** remote

OE uses it's own modified version of lirc so you need to be editing the
lircmap.xml.
 simple change the remote device to "*devinput*" and reboot:
 "<remote device="devinput">"

** add system config files

the filesystem is read only therefore just stick the same files in the
/storage/.config IE:
 /storage/.config/modprobe.d/

** find out which version of openelec is installed

connect through ssh and look for the info
 [[xbmc_files/img/Image.png]]
 also:
 when OE boots there will be a version number in the upper left corner

** manual update

﻿

First of all, head over to the downloads page and download the latest
release of OpenELEC. Use your favourite archiving utility to extract the
files from the archive you've downloaded (7zip is my favourite Windows
archiver).

Now, from your PC, open a Explorer window and browse to the IP address
of the OpenELEC machine (if you don't know what the IP address is, go to
the menu of the OpenELEC machine, and browse to the main item "System"
and then its subitem "System Info". This will open a page that shows the
IP address amongst other information.

So type this into the address bar of the explorer window. For example,
if your IP address is 192.168.1.92, browse to:

 \\192.168.1.92
 [[xbmc_files/img/Howto-samba-img1.png]]

[[http://wiki.openelec.tv/index.php?title=File:Howto-samba-img1.png][
]]Once the window appears, open the "Update" folder share. There
shouldn't be anything inside this share, unless you have another update
pending.

From the folder you extracted the new release into, open the target
folder. Inside you should find four files. Grab *KERNEL*, *KERNEL.md5*,
*SYSTEM* and *SYSTEM.md5* from here (*/dont ignore the MD5 files/*) and
copy/extract them to the Update share on the OpenELEC machine.

 Finish

Once the files have been copied, reboot the OpenELEC machine. OpenELEC
will recognize the new system files and update them internally. A second
reboot will follow automatically to activate the new system files.

** install streamzap remote

First, I plug in USB receiver.
 Second, I install LIRC from the Ubuntu repository:

sudo apt-get install lirc

 Third, I start to configure LIRC for the streamzap remote:

sudo dpkg-reconfigure lirc

 Fourth, I select "Streamzap PC Remote" as the receiving device and
"None" as the transmitting device in the configuration window, which
completes the configuration.
 Fifth, I verify that the configuration is correct in
/etc/lirc/hardware.conf and /etc/lirc/lircd.conf (both are the same as
what's listed in the wiki).
 Sixth, I restart LIRC:

sudo /etc/init.d/lirc restart

 Seventh, I try to get a signal from the remote by pressing buttons
after typing the following command:

irw

* mysql

** setting mysql

*﻿Setting up the MySQL server*

You'll need to choose which of your computers, XBMC devices, or
[[http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=NAS][NAS]] will be the MySQL
server. The server needs to be on 24/7 or have wake-on-lan (preferably
the former), and needs to have a local static IP. You will probably want
the XBMC device that is hosting most or all of your videos and music to
also be the MySQL server, but this is not required.

 *On your server/pc install mysql as instructed by distro instructions*
 IE for ARCH see the linux NC notebook
 for ubuntu see the xbmc guide:

[[http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Synchronize_multiple_XBMC_libraries][http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Synchronize\_multiple\_XBMC\_libraries]]
 *Create a password when asked.*
 Then restart MySQL:

systemctl start mysqld.service

 Create a password when asked
 To configure MySQL to listen for connections from network hosts, edit
/etc/mysql/my.cnf and change the bind-address directive to the server's
IP address:
 from:
 #bind-address = 127.0.0.1
 to:
 bind-address = 192.168.0.5
 Note: Replace 192.168.0.5 with the appropriate address.
 Note: Alternatively you can comment out bind-address using a hash(#) to
allow local and remote access.
 Restart your MySQL server.
 Get into the MySQL command line utility:

 $mysql -u root -p

 Enter the following commands:
 Type in:

 CREATE USER 'xbmc' IDENTIFIED BY 'xbmc';

 Type in:

 GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'xbmc';

 Close out the command line tool with

 \q

*SELECT host,user from mysql.user;
 SHOW DATABASES;
*
 *note: on arch linux make sure to enable the mysqld in the hosts.allow
*

** setup xbmc with mysql

*Setting up XBMC
*
 1)Open XBMC on the computer that has the library you want to share*(If
you have not created a library yet you can skip this step)*
 Notice: If your existing library was set up with local file paths
rather than network shares, then you will need to follow the conversion
guide in addition to sharing the files on the network.
 Export the Video Library by doing the following:
 Go to System/Settings -> Video -> Library and select Export
library
 Select Single file
 Export the Music Library by doing the following:
 Go to System/Settings -> Music -> Library and select Export
library
 Select Single file
 2) Create (or add to, if you already have one) an advancedsettings.xml
file:
 Open up a plain text editor and Copy and paste the text below
into a new text document:
 <advancedsettings>
 <videodatabase>
 <type>mysql</type>
 <host>***.***.***.***</host>
 <port>3306</port>
 <user>xbmc</user>
 <pass>xbmc</pass>
 </videodatabase>
 <musicdatabase>
 <type>mysql</type>
 <host>***.***.***.***</host>
 <port>3306</port>
 <user>xbmc</user>
 <pass>xbmc</pass>
 </musicdatabase>
 </advancedsettings>
 Replace the two instances of ***.***.***.*** with local network IP
address of your MySQL server
 Save the file as advancedsettings.xml
 4)Copy this advancedsettings.xml file you just created to the userdata
folder of every XBMC install you want to sync with:
 Windows XP: *Documents and Settings\<your\_user\_name>\Application
Data\XBMC\userdata\advancedsettings.xml*
 Vista/Windows 7:
*Users\<your\_user\_name>\AppData\Roaming\XBMC\userdata\advancedsettings.xml*
 Mac OS X: */Users/<your\_user\_name>/Library/Application
Support/XBMC/userdata/advancedsettings.xml*
 iOS:
*/private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/XBMC/userdata/advancedsettings.xml*
 Linux: *$HOME/.xbmc/userdata/advancedsettings.xml*
 5) Open any of your XBMC installs and re-import your library data (*If
you have not created a library yet you can skip this step*)
 Import the Video Library by doing the following:
 Go to System/Settings -> Video -> Library and select Import
library
 Select the file you saved from the first step when you
exported your video library
 
 Import the Music Library by doing the following:
 Go to System/Settings -> Music -> Library and select Import
library
 Select the file you saved from the first step when you
exported your music library
 6) You can now add files and update the library from any of your XBMC
boxes and the library for all of them will stay in sync.
 NOTE: If you want to update the library from any of the XBMC
devices then they must all have the same sources set. See the Sources
section of Part 6 for one method of keeping them in sync.
 NOTE: If you encounter error 1062, then you'll need to change your
paths from "\\" to "//" as MySQL has trouble understanding "\\"
 

** Syncing thumbnails and fanart

Syncing thumbnails and fanart
 While syncing thumbnails and fanart is not required for sharing
multiple XBMC libraries, doing so is highly recommended as it:
 -saves storage space by having thumbnails and fanart in just one
network shared location
 -saves time by not having to re-download the images separately for each
XBMC device
 The Thumbnail folder in XBMC contains both thumbnails and fanart. If
you have imported from pre-existing media libraries then you can use
your old thumbnail folder to save time on re-downloading images, but
only if you did not use local file paths and only had network shares on
your exported library. Otherwise you will have to update your library to
re-download thumbnails and fanart.
 add to advancedsettings.xml:
 Copy the text from below and add it to your advancedsettings.xml file,
but make sure you add the text before the </advancedsettings> tag at the
end.
 <pathsubstitution>
 <substitute>
 <from>special://masterprofile/Thumbnails/</from>
 <to>REPLACE\_THIS\_TEXT</to>
 </substitute>
 </pathsubstitution>
 Share your existing Thumbnail folder or a new folder via NFS, SMB, or
AFP.
 It's easiest to do this from the same computer/device as your MySQL
server.
 Windows XP: Documents and
Settings\<your\_user\_name>\Application Data\XBMC\userdata\Thumbnails\
 Vista/Windows 7:
Users\<your\_user\_name>\AppData\Roaming\XBMC\userdata\Thumbnails\
 Mac OS X: /Users/<your\_user\_name>/Library/Application
Support/XBMC/userdata/Thumbnails/
 iOS:
/private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/XBMC/userdata/Thumbnails/
 Linux: $HOME/.xbmc/userdata/Thumbnails/
 Copy the network path of your shared Thumbnails folder and use that to
replace REPLACE\_THIS\_TEXT.
 Make sure all XBMC devices that are being synced have this addition to
their advancedsettings.xml file.

** install

on Linux:

 wget
[[http://svn.stmlabs.com/svn/raspbmc/testing/installers/python/install.py][http://svn.stmlabs.com/svn/raspbmc/testing/installers/python/install.py]]
 chmod +x install.py

 Now we need to run the installation script with root privileges as we
will be writing to an SD card. In some distributions you can do this by
prefixing the command withsudowhereas in some you will need tosu
root. You should consult your OS documentation for more help on this
matter. But in the case of a standard Debian install, one would run:

 sudo python install.py

 You will then be greeted with a screen similar to the one below. You
are now using the installer. Simply follow the instructions and you
should be fine.
