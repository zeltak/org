#+TITLE: P047_MAIAC_Births_MA
* MAIAC Birth weight analysis
** Prepare data
*** assign new MAIAC guid to cases
using the old BW data from 2000-2008 GIS arcgis location file we created a simple X,Y, ID dataset in GIS and imported it as a shape file
$Note the X,Y here is lat,long variables$


** 1.Arrange birth data
*** 1. Original data
+The fist stage included obtaining original birth weight data. The data
came from Ariana Zeka in the following folder:
 S:\ENVEPI\AZEKA\BIRTHS
 the file is named ALLCOMPLETE\_07JUNE06.SAS7BDAT:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.1.Raw\_data\original
data\ALLCOMPLETE\_07JUNE06.SAS7BDAT
 then in SAS the file was opened (NOTE: opening in SPSS first will
mess-up the date string)
 NOTE: latitude and longtuide are NOT the cases xy!!! this is:
 GDTLat -- latitude from GDT (now Teleatlas)
 GDTLong -- longitude from GDT (now Teleatlas)
 Later the file was latter exported to dbf for ArcGIS birth\_short.dbf:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.1.Raw\_data\original
data\birth\_short.dbf+
 New bigger dataset
 data for 2000-2008 came from the mass-dph through steve
 the raw file is here:

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.1.Raw\_data\original
data\new 00-09\
*
 The file was loaded in sas using this script cn001\_sas\_import.sas
 and subsseted to relevant years and exported to dbf
 the *results/output* are located here in :

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN001\_BW\_meta\_Final\births\_guid\_meta0008.dbf*
 Â 

*** 2.ArcGIS

the exported dbf file for birth cases was imported into arcgis
 also a cliped guid layer with LU terms was also imported
 then a spatial join was preformed using*arctoolbox*:
 [[Births_MA_files/img/Image.png]]
 where the births layer (cases) was joined to the guid (pm location
point) to get each a unique guid for each case and the LU for that guid.
 then the final layer was exported to dbf and is located here
births\_guid\_meta.dbf:

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN001\_BW\_meta\_Final\births\_guid\_meta0008\_lu.dbf
*
 NOTE: we found that in 2003 the lat and long was swithced...so we ran
the whole 2 and 3 steps again only for 2003 and joined that the full bw
dataset in step 4

*** 3.SAS join PM to births

[[Births_MA_files/attach/sas_merge.sas][Attachment #01
(sas\_merge.sas)]]
 in SAS using cn004\_sas\_merge\_0008
 the the birth weight file is joined to the poll file
 the variables are cleaned and re-named
 the file is subsetted as to not to include any C-section cases.
 results in this file in the same location:
 *

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.4.Work\3.Analysis\2.R\_analysis\bw0008\_nocs.csv
*

*** 4.Check localPM pollution

Local lu terms for each mother birth address was calculated using the
same methods for the local monitor stage in the NE predictions for the
monitor (see NE documents). the only differenace was tden which use
method 2 (also see NE documents) since the cases dataset was huge.
 the data was then exported here:

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN008\_BW\_LU50m\bw\_LU.dbf
*
 then the script was executed and it generated local PM prediction for
each birth case.
 the *results/output* are located here in :

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN009\_BW\_LPM\g3.csv*

** 2.Bw Statistical analysis

*** 1.Sas mixed model regression exploratory

using these script we explored different models
 *AN\_001\_SAS\_mixed.sas*-normal mixed model with the BW
 *AN\_002\_R\_mixed.r*- for logistic regressions
 *AN\_004\_SAS\_compare\_cw.sas*-comparing to CW data
 the results are saved here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.11.BirthW\_NE\3.1.11.5.Results\OR001\_SAS\_mixed\_exploratory\

 NOTE: the final results for the paper are in the next script

*** 2.SAS/R Final results

we used the scripts AN\_010\_Paper for the final results for the paper:
 for the mixed models and interactions. the results are here:

** 3.paper preparation

*** a.create GIS maps

in GIS a Empty MA grid was loaded (obtained through steve) for a smaple
10x10km day
 to make the " perfectly squre" it was loaded as a UTM 19N proj.
 mortality rates were improrted with the XY import and also loaded as a
UTM 19N proj.
 [[Births_MA_files/img/SS-2011-02-04_11.10.07.jpg]]
 later other layers such as state border were cleared of the proj and i
used the import proj from the grid layer
