each run of the model needs inputs:

namelist: this is where variables for the model are defined:

Description of namelist variables
(Updated for WRF 2.1)
---------------------------------

 Note: variables followed by (max_dom) indicate that this variable needs to
       be defined for the nests when max_dom > 1.

 &time_control
 run_days                            = 1,	; run time in days
 run_hours                           = 0,	; run time in hours
                                                  Note: if it is more than 1 day, one may use both run_days and run_hours
                                                  or just run_hours. e.g. if the total run length is 36 hrs, you may
                                                  set run_days = 1, and run_hours = 12, or run_days = 0, and run_hours = 36
 run_minutes                         = 0,	; run time in minutes
 run_seconds                         = 0,	; run time in seconds
 start_year (max_dom)                = 2001,	; four digit year of starting time
 start_month (max_dom)               = 06,	; two digit month of starting time
 start_day (max_dom)                 = 11,	; two digit day of starting time
 start_hour (max_dom)                = 12,	; two digit hour of starting time
 start_minute (max_dom)              = 00,	; two digit minute of starting time
 start_second (max_dom)              = 00,	; two digit second of starting time
                                                  Note: the start time is used to name the first wrfout file.
                                                  It also controls the start time for nest domains, and the time to restart
 end_year (max_dom)                  = 2001,	; four digit year of ending time
 end_month (max_dom)                 = 06,	; two digit month of ending time
 end_day (max_dom)                   = 12,	; two digit day of ending time
 end_hour (max_dom)                  = 12,	; two digit hour of ending time
 end_minute (max_dom)                = 00,	; two digit minute of ending time
 end_second (max_dom)                = 00,	; two digit second of ending time
                                                  It also controls when the nest domain integrations end
                                                  All start and end times are used by real.exe.

                                                  Note that one may use either run_days/run_hours etc. or 
                                                  end_year/month/day/hour etc. to control the length of 
                                                  model integration. But run_days/run_hours
                                                  takes precedence over the end times.
