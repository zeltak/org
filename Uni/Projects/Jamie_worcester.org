** 1.intro

** 2.gather data

*** 1.patient layer

patient data was obtained from Jamie and is located here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.9\_Jamie\_Worcester\3.1.9.1.Raw\_data\patient\_data\
 *the X,Y cord are in the MA state projection:*
 Projected Coordinate Systems > State Plane> NAD 1983 (Meters) > NAD
1983 StatePlane Massachusetts FIPS 2001 (Meters).prj
 data was imported to GIS using X,Y and converted to layeres
 then the 2 datasets were combined and a new field to indicate was
created (ca\_co) where:
 0-was for cases
 1-for control
 finally the combined dataset was reprojected to UTM:
 [[Jamie_worcester_files/img/SS-2011-06-22_10.19.08.png]]
 resulting in layer*Cases\_controls\_utm*

*** 2.LU data

all the LU variables on a 50x50 resolution for the resid (mod4) stage
was obtained in rasters from steve:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.9\_Jamie\_Worcester\3.1.9.1.Raw\_data\GIS\
 *the only one not included* is trafiic density (the total road Length
in each point (50X50m)

*** 3.joind LU data to patients

in GIS the LU rasters were joined one by one to the cases/control
dataset using the spatial analyst tools:

 [[Jamie_worcester_files/img/SS-2011-06-22_10.16.05.png]]
 *NOTE: for percent urban the raster value has to be divided by 9 to get
the actual percent*
 *
 NOTE: since Each variable is called RASTERVALUE, gis wont be able to
extract values for another variable with the same name (it will give all
values a NULL value). To address this simple create a new variable ,
copy the raster value to it and delete the raster value field
 [[Jamie_worcester_files/img/SS-2011-06-22_12.56.54.png]]*
 for popden- *gn1
*elev-*gn3*
 percent urban-*gn4*

*** 4.join patients to guid

the *gn4* layer with all LU data was joined to a guid layer so that each
patient got a specific guid
 [[Jamie_worcester_files/img/SS-2011-06-22_13.05.50.png]]
 *NOTE: we also added the guid LU terms for the deltas later on*
 resulting in *gn5
*this is exported to dbf here:

** 3.Analysis

*** 1.prediction models

using script *cn001* we get prdicted residual PM (local exposure) for
the wooster cases/control .
 the output file is here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.9\_Jamie\_Worcester\3.1.9.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\lu\_guis\_resid\_final\lu\_resid.csv

*** 2.combine with pm prediction for 2000

using script *cn002* we combine the local pollution with the average
pollution for the year 2000 from our prediction models
 the output is here

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.9\_Jamie\_Worcester\3.1.9.4.Work\3.Analysis\final
cases\casesfinal.sas7bdat

*** 3.multi year pm predictions

using script *cn003* we combine the local pollution with the average
pollution for all years seperatly 2000-2005 from our prediction models
 the output is here
