** 1.intro

** 2.gather data

*** 1.data

data was obtained from Lee Dietrich (lee.dietterich@gmail.com) and
located here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.7.Zinc\3.1.7.1.Raw\_data\XLS\
 the document on that is here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.7.Zinc\3.1.7.1.Raw\_data\Docs\
 the files used were :

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.7.Zinc\3.1.7.1.Raw\_data\XLS\All
Data Summary.xls

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.7.Zinc\3.1.7.1.Raw\_data\XLS\Original
Raw Data Final v2.xls*
*which were loaded to SPSS and converted (*see next step*)
 the 2 data files differ in that:
 1)RAW data- is the primary dataset
 2)the SUMMARY data - includes the primary data, secondary data and
literature data

*** 2.Convert Raw data to R in spss

the original xls file was loaded to Spss from here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.7.Zinc\3.1.7.1.Raw\_data\XLS\Original
Raw Data Paired Treatment Means.xls
 unwanted string variables were deleted (comments etc)
 then recoding took place using cn001
 1)water -> irreg :
 0-dry
 1-wet
 . sys missing
 2)crop -> crop type
 [[Zinc_files/img/SS-2011-05-12_10.54.09.png]]
 3)cultivar -> cultiv
 [[Zinc_files/img/SS-2011-05-12_10.56.24.png]]
 *Note:missing had to be recoded again (see script cn001)*
 4)nitrogen application -> nitro
 0-no
 1-yes
 and
 nitrogen application -> nitro\_continous
 to have a continous variable
 5) CO2inthissample -> CO
 0-ambient
 1-elevated
 6)study-> study\_area
 [[Zinc_files/img/SS-2011-05-12_12.20.53.png]]
 7)location -> loc
 [[Zinc_files/img/SS-2011-05-12_12.22.45.png]]

*** 3.Convert summary data to R in spss

recoding took place using cn002\_summary\_data.sps

** 3.Analysis

*** 1.SAS

we used the script sas\_mixed\_with\_v3.sas to run a stratified analysis
by crop and group for both dataset (raw and summary)
 the results are outputed here as sas files:

*** 1.mixed models for raw data

a mixed model was run using script cn001.
 NOTE:
 to extract the random slopes top add to the fixed effect we ran this in
the above script
               
 zinc3 <- lmer( zinc\_ppm ~
CO+as.factor(year)+(1|pairnumber)+(1+CO|crop),na.action=na.omit,data =
zinc\_sum)
 summary(zinc3)
 ##extract SE extract the random coeefiecnt of random slope and add to
fixed effect ##NEED TO EXTRACT EACH RANDOM CO COEF AND ADD TO FIXED CO
(-2.33)
 ran <- ranef(zinc3)
 then in the ran object took the random effects for *crop* (copied
manually):
 [[Zinc_files/img/SS-2011-05-27_13.31.44.png]]
 then each random effect was added to the fixed effect to get the final
coeeficent:
 [[Zinc_files/img/SS-2011-05-27_13.36.02.png]]

*** 2.mixed models summary data (meta analysis)

for the summary data mixed model was run using script cn002.
 then in the ran object took the random effects for *crop* (copied
manually):
 [[Zinc_files/img/Image_x80Npeq0iXoc5lZJilZ2TA_0001.png]]
 then each random effect was added to the fixed effect to get the final
coeeficent:
 [[Zinc_files/img/Image_x80Npeq0iXoc5lZJilZ2TA_0002.png]]
