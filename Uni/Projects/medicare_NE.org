* H.Hospital Admitance

** 1.Intro

*** 1.variable info

codes:
 *sex:*
 1-male
 2-female
 *Race:*
 1-white
 2-black
 3-other
 admission types:
 cvd- cardiovascular disease

** 2.Gather data

*** 1.create zipcode keytable

using *cn000\_create\_zipcode\_DB.sas* a file with all Zipcodes in NE
with XY was loaded to sas:
 *NOTE: zipcodes for the whole USA is also available in the same
location*

C:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.1.Raw\_data\a.import
into GIS\zip\_NE\_2005.dbf
 the zipcode file with xy is aggregated and then is exported for
creating a guid-zipcode keyfile:

C:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\ArcGIS\zipagg.dbf

*** 2.Assign guid to zipcodes

The zipagg.dbf file was loaded to GIS and then uising a spatial join it
was joined to the guid layer with the closest (within 14km) option so
gricodes outside NE would get a NULL value iin guid
 Then resulting key file is *l*ocated here:

C:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN007\_keyed\_tables\zipcode\_guid.dbf

*** 3.merge keytable with admissions DB

using *cn001\_create\_admiss\_DB.sas* the original admission sas data
file (*newengland.sas7bdat*) located:

C:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.1.Raw\_data\a.import
into GIS\newengland.sas7bdat
 was loaded to SAS then the admission file is merged with the zip codes
and X,Y cords keytable
 then the file is split into cases files and outputted as dbf here:

C:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN001\_Cases\_guid\ari.dbf

*** 4.SES status

in GIS using layers/datsets from Steve SES variables are calculated in
ARCGIS for every 10x10km cell
 the data is outputted here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN0021\_calculate\_SES\SES\_NE.dbf
 later *we added some LU data to the SES data* (spatial join with LU
data for the 10x10km grid)
 this is outputted here:

C:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN0021\_calculate\_SES\SES\_NE\_LU.dbf

*** 5.assign exposure

Using cn004
(c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.3.Code\2.Gather\_data\cn004\_assign\_exposure\_by\_type\_guid.sas)
:
 in this step the cases (by admission type seperatly) were assigned
exposure by guid and date in addition to long term pm exposure (chronic)
 also SES data were dichotomized
 the final result is exported to R and located :
 *NOTE: diab2 is all diabetic cases (weather or not main casue) and diab
is just main admission casue for daib*

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.4.Work\3.Analysis\AN001\_R\_files\_bycase\diab0106.csv

** 3.Analysis

*** 1.run ts with lag

[[medicare_NE_files/attach/poison_ts_lagpm][Attachment #01
(poison\_ts\_lagpm)]]
 The R time series script was run in R using script ALL\_causes

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.10.Medicare\_NE\3.1.10.3.Code\3.Analysis\ALL\_causes.r
 lag 0 ,1 and 2 were tested
