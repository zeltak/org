** 1.intro

*** data sources

data was obtained through steve
 steves added local 50x50 LU data to the dataset:
 the RAW NAS data is located at:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.19.VIVA\3.1.6.1.Raw\_data\VIVA
data\viva\_gisvariables\_50m\_0328012.xls

*** NAS dataset info

*aid\_ct* is the subject id
 *addressid* is the unique id for location

** 2.gather data

*** 2.create local predictions (50x50)

**** 1.create LU variables

steve already calculated LU variables at a 50x50m resolution for each
VIVA case.
 we did however have to add the distance to local point emission
variable with a simple spatial join
 also we added the guid closest to each case
 the *results/output* are located here in :
 *

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.19.VIVA\3.1.6.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN004\_VIVA\_lu\cases\_lu.dbf*

**** 2.calculate local PM

using script cn010\_localPM\_NAS
 *NOTE: since there are no time varying variables there can only be
chronic effect and no short term (acute) effect for the NAS patient from
the local traffic
*
 we calculate the local pm prediction for each subject*
*
 the *results/output* are located here in :

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.6.NAS\3.1.6.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN010\_localPM\_predictions\nas\_lpm.csv*

*** 2.create 10x10 exposure dataset

**** 1.create poll 00-08 dataset

using script cn001\_create\_full\_nas\_dataset we assign exposure to all
NAS cases. in this detailed script each NAS patient gets a one year lag
with relative pm for a period if he switched residence

**** 2.Assign exposure to NAS cases

using script cn002\_assign\_exposure the pollution dataset was created
for all available day for all NAS cases location so we get a full set of
every case with 9x365 pmnew days (and lags)
 the *results/output* are located here in :

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.6.NAS\3.1.6.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN020\_Final\_NAS\_POLL\final\_nas\_poll.sas7bdat
*
 then we add the local pm stage prediction to the above files
 the *results/output* are located here in :

*c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.6.NAS\3.1.6.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\FN020\_Final\_NAS\_POLL\final\_nas\_poll\_lpm.sas7bdat
*

*** 7.prepare for marieablle comparison

**** 1.create met and pm countway data

using script *cn005* we created countway data for pm and met variables
(spss)

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.6.NAS\3.1.6.1.Raw\_data\MET\countway00\_09.sas7bdat

**** 2.create lags

using script *cn006* we created lags for the countway pm data, temp data
and humidaty data
 this is outputed as a sas file here:
 libname cwx
"c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.6.NAS\3.1.6.4.Work\2.Gather\_data\cw\_data\cway\_lags"

**** 7.add cw data to NAS\_poll data

using script *cn0067* we added the cw data to the nas dataset with our
predicted pollution
 this is outputed as a sas file here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.6.NAS\3.1.6.4.Work\3.Analysis\MB\_analysis\mb1\_met.csv

**** finalize for mb analysis

added met data (temprature and relative humidaty) from the countway
dataset
 in addition the key outcome variables were log transformed
 this was exported to R for the mb analaysis here:

c:\Users\ekloog\Documents\$Doc\3.PostDoc\3.1.Projetcs\3.1.6.NAS\3.1.6.4.Work\3.Analysis\MB\_analysis\mb1\_met.csv

** 3.Analysis

*** 1.marie-belle analysis

**** 1.calculate local PM (resid)

using the cn001 script in R, the local pm (residuals methos) for each
NAS patient was calculated
 this is later exported to csv:

c:/Users/ekloog/Documents/$Doc/3.PostDoc/3.1.Projetcs/3.1.6.NAS/3.1.6.4.Work/3.Analysis/nas\_with\_resid/nas\_resid.csv
 for the lag join so the dataset gets all the lags

**** 2.MB analysis comparison

using the *cn007\_mb* script we ran the same test as marie bell did in
her analysis but using our PM models instead of the countway PM data
 we also tried the same exact test using count way PM instead of ours
using *cn008\_mb*

*** 2.stacey black carbon comparison

**** 2.comparison

we ran a comparison using script *cn009\_mb*
