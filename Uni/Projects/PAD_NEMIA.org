* PAD
**** idea
By reading this paper it came back to my mind that there is another orphan cardiovascular disease in air pollution research: peripheral artery disease. This is usually due to atherosclerosis and narrowing of the arteries in the limbs and an lead to severe outcomes such as amputation.
It makes sense to be affected by air pollution, but last time I checked no one had published anything on this. With a large database and geospatial resolution, PAD would be an obvious one to look at.
**** data from antonella
when there is no 2, it means that they are created form first diagnosis, when there is the 2 it means that are created based on 1 and up to 5 secondary diagnosis
so the ones with the 2 should have higher numbers of hospitalizations
