*Evaluation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) attributed
to O_{3}, NO_{2}, and SO_{2} in ambient air of Tabriz by using Air Q
Model*

*Abstract*

Air quality is a major environmental issues related to human health.
Both the general population and decision makers are increasingly aware
of the detrimental effects of low air quality and health outcomes. The
objectives of the present study were to provide quantitative data on the
impact of air pollution on the health of residents living in Tabriz,
Iran. We examined the associations between gaseous pollutants and
hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) among
residents of Tabriz, a city in which ambient air pollution levels are
relatively high among other cities in Iran. We applied the approach
proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the AirQ software
developed by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health. Daily
concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide were used
to assess human exposure and health effect in terms of attributable
proportion of the health outcome and annual number of excess cases of
Hospital Admissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (HA
COPD).The results of this study showed that 2% (95% CI: 0.8--3.1%) of HA
COPD were attributed to O_{3} concentrations over 10 μg/m^{3}. In
addition, 0.7 % (95% CI: 0.1- 1.8%) and 0.5% (95% CI: 0--1%) of HA COPD
were attributed to NO_{2} and SO_{2} concentrations over 10μg/m^{3}
respectively. For every 10μg/m^{3} increase in O_{3}, NO_{2} and SO_{2}
concentrations, the risk of HA COPD increased by 0.58, 0.38 and 0.44
percent respectively. In this study we have shown that ozone, nitrogen
dioxide and sulfur dioxide have a significant impact on COPD
hospitalization. Further studies are needed to assess other health
impacts and quantification of the health effects of exposure to other
pollutants in urban atmospheres.

1. *Introduction*

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important disease
worldwide in both high-income and low-income countries [1-4]. By the
year 2020, it has been estimated that COPD will rank fifth among the
conditions with a high burden to society and third among the most
important causes of death humans worldwide [4, 5]. The economic burden
of COPD on any society can be enormous [6].

Air pollution has been recognized as a trigger for intensification of
COPD for more than 50 years and has lead to the development of air
quality standards in many countries of world that have resulted in
substantially decreased levels of varies of air pollutants derived from
the burning of different fossil fuels [7]. However, this decrease in the
levels of foretime air pollutants was been accompanied by an increase in
the levels of other pollutants, such as ozone (O_{3}), sulfur dioxide
(SO_{2}), and nitrogen dioxide (NO_{2}) which are associated with
increased motor vehicle traffic in many urban areas [8, 9].

. In urban areas, outdoor air pollution is a main public health problem
largely due to emissions of air pollutants from both industrial plants
and motor vehicles. The degree of exposure to ambient air pollutants
however is variable over time primarily due to changes in pollutant
emissions and weather conditions [4, 10]. There is strong evidence from
multiple studies over the past few years supporting and the asscociation
between traffic-related air pollution and adverse effect on lung
development in children aged 10--18 years [11, 12]. In addition, studies
have shown that

air pollutants have adverse effects on the pulmonary airway. Particulate
pollutants, ozone (O_{3}), nitrogen dioxide (NO_{2}) and sulfur dioxide
(SO_{2}) can all produce deleterious effects on the airway, such as an
increase in bronchial reactivity [13], airway oxidative stress [14],
pulmonary and systemic inflammation[15, 16], amplification of viral
infections[17], and reduction in airway ciliary activity[4, 18]. There
is thus evidence of biological plausibility that showing how air
pollution can cause damage in the lungs[4].

Stieb and colleagues [19] showed how an increase of 18.4 ppb level of
ozone (O_{3}) concentration was associated with increased emergency room
visits for asthma 3.2% (95% CI: 0.3--6.2%) but not COPD 3.7% (95% CI:
--0.5--7.9%) with a lag of two days.

Gaseous pollutants like O_{3}, NO_{2} and sulfur dioxide (SO_{2}), and
particulate pollutants like PM_{10} are highly reactive oxidants and can
cause inflammation of the respiratory epithelium at high concentrations
[20-22]. Sulfur dioxide (SO_{2}) is very soluble in the upper
respiratory tract and thus may produce an urgent irritant effect on the
respiratory mucosa that would account for the fact that no lag days were
observed for SO_{2} [23, 24].

Tabriz (located in southwestern Iran) with a population of over one and
a half million peoples is the fourth most populous city in Iran after
Tehran, Mashhad and Isfahan. This city is one of the seven polluted
Iranian metropolises. In this study we examined Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) attributed to O_{3}, NO_{2}, and SO_{2} in
ambient air of Tabriz by using Air Q Model during 2009 and 2010.

AirQ software was proved to be a valid and reliable tool to estimate the
potential short-term effects of air pollution, predicts health end
points attributed to criteria pollutants, and allows the examination of
various scenarios in which emission rates of pollutants are varied.

*2. Material and Method*

/2.1. AirQ software/

We applied the approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO)
using the AirQ 2.2.3 software developed by the WHO European Centre for
Environment and Health, Bilthoven Division (ADD REFRENCE HERE). This
model is used to estimate the impacts of exposure to specific Air
pollutants on the health of people at certain time periods and
locations. The assessment is based on the attributable proportion (AP),
defined as the fraction of the health outcome in a certain population
attributable to exposure to a given atmospheric pollutant. The AP is
calculated as follows [25, 26]:

AP = SUM {(RR(c)-1) ×p(c)} /SUM (RR(c) ×p(c)) (1)

Where AP is the attributable proportion of the health outcome, assuming
a proven causal relation between exposure and health outcome and no
major confounding effects in that association. RR is the relative risk
for a given health outcome, P(c) is the population of exposure. In
statistics and mathematical epidemiology, relative risk (RR) is the risk
of an event (or of developing a disease) relative to exposure. Relative
risk is a ratio of the probability of the event occurring in the exposed
group versus a non-exposed group. The RR can be easily calculated by the
following general formula [25, 26]:

RR= (Probability of event When exposed) */* (Probability of event When
non-exposed) (2)

If the baseline frequency of the health outcome in the population under
investigation is known, the rate attributable to the exposure can be
calculated as

IE= I ×AP (3)

Where IE is the rate of the health outcome attributable to the exposure
and I is the baseline frequency of the health outcome in the population
under investigation. Knowing the size of the population, the number of
cases attributable to the exposure can be estimated as follows:

NE= IE ×N (4)

Where NE is the number of cases attributed to the exposure and N is the
size of the population investigated.

Three ranges of relative risk based on model's default were considered
for assessing health effects of O_{3}, NO_{2} and SO_{2}. Furthermore,
baseline incidence (BI) values were also taken from default of the model
and it is of 101.4 per one hundred thousand peoples each year.

/2.2. Exposure assessment/

Air concentrations of O_{3}, NO_{2} and SO_{2} in Tabriz, were measured
by the Eastern Azerbaijan Department of Environment (EADoE), using fixed
stations in six areas covering 365 days (21^{th} Mars 2011 to 21^{th}
Mars 2012). The six monitored stations were Abrasan
(residential-commercial area in the east city), Baqshomal
(residential-commercial area in the city center), Health center
(residential area in the north city), Hakim nezami (residential area in
the south city), Rah ahan (Commercial Industrial area in the west city)
and Raste kouche (commercial area in the city center).

PERHAPS ADD A FIGURE HERE OF THE SPATIAL LOCATIONS OF THESE MONITORS IN
THE STUDY AREA

These data were collected on a volumetric base. We related the mass of
pollutants inhaled to the health effects studied (NAME THEM HERE and
STATE HOW YOU RELATED THEM). The AirQ model was on gravimetric basis.
So, we needed to convert units between AirQ model and EADoE data.. All
processing mechanisms for conversion between volumetric and gravimetric
units, such as correction of temperature and pressure, coding, averaging
and filtering were performed using STATE SOFTWARE HERE.

For all the pollutants, the parameters required by the software (annual
and seasonal average, maximum and annual 98^{th} percentiles) were
obtained and concentrations were divided into 10 μg/m^{3} categories,
corresponding to equivalent exposure categories. For O_{3}, data were
expressed as a one hour (1h) average; for NO_{2} and SO_{2}, as daily
average concentrations. The software assumes that concentrations
measured are representative of the average exposure of the people.

Finally, the association between air pollution and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) was assessed using AirQ2.2.3 Software.

*3. Results*

The annual average maximum of 1h, summer average, winter average and 98
percentile of O_{3} concentrations in these stations have been presented
in table 1. For O_{3} the maximum 1 annual average concentration was
43μg/m^{3}, detected as expected in summer, whiles the maximum 1 annual
average concentration, 50μg/m^{3}, was detected in winter.

*4. Discussion*

For our population of one and half millions people and base on BI of
101.4 per one hundred thousand peoples each year, some 1,567 COPD cases
can be expected annually, out of this number, 31, 12 and 8 cases can be
attributed to the O_{3}, NO_{2} and SO_{2} concentrations above 20
μg/m^{3}, respectively. 79.2% of COPD cases occurred in days with
pollutant not exceeding 60μg/m^{3}.

For troposphere ozone in Tabriz, the annual average maximum of one hour
concentration, summer average, winter average and 98 percentile were
detected 44, 43, 50 and 84μg/m^{3} respectively. This data were detected
72.62, 84.38, 60.51 and 121.44μg/m^{3} in Ahvaz, Iran. So, this finding
is less than consistent with recent results reported by Zallaghi et al.
in Ahvaz, Iran [27]. More than 96.7% of COPD is attributable to days
that concentration of ozone did not exceed the 100μg/m^{3} and in
concentration under 10μg/m^{3} of ozone there are not Hospital
Admissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (HA COPD). For
every 10 micrograms per cubic meters increase in ozone concentration,
the risk of HA COPD about 0.58 percent increase. Also the study in
Tehran, Iran was showed that increasing of the ozone concentration for
10 micrograms per cubic meters, increases the risk of COPD 0.86% (95%
CI: 0.44--1.3%) and 93 percent of HA COPD is attributable to days that
concentration of ozone did not exceed the 110μg/m^{3}. So the results of
the two studies are somewhat close together and ozone pollution in
metropolitan of Tabriz is approximately equal with megacity of Tehran,
Iran [28].

Indicators of relative risk (RR) and Attributable Proportion (AP) for
COPD to nitrogen dioxide at is defined on baseline Incidence (BI) 101.4
at 10^{5} persons by the WHO. The results of this study showed that 2%
(95% CI: 0.8---3.1%) of Hospital Admissions for Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (HA COPD) were attributed to O_{3} concentrations over
10 μg/m^{3}. The results of another study in Ahvaz, Iran, showed that
3.52% (95% CI: 0.05--5.58%) of HA COPD were attributed to O_{3}
concentrations over 10 μg/m^{3} [27]. Also, 0.7 % (95% CI: 0.1- 1.8%) of
HA COPD and 0.5% (95% CI: 0--1 %) of HA COPD were attributed to NO_{2}
and SO_{2} concentrations over 10 μg/m^{3} respectively. For every 10
micrograms per cubic meters increase in NO_{2} and SO_{2}
concentrations, the risk of HA COPD about o.38 and 0.44 percent
increase, respectively.

ADD A SECTION HERE ON HOW THESE RESULTS COMPARE TO PREVIOUS STUDIES IN
IRAN AND ELSEWHERE. THIS IS CRUCIAL TO GIVE YOU WORK VALIDATION- YOU
MUST COMPARE IT TO OTHER PUBLISHED SIMILAR STUDIES

In this study, we have shown that ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur
dioxide have a significant impact on COPD hospitalization.

Given these results, the following actions are needed in order to reduce
the health effects caused by air pollution and better quantification
studies are recommended:

- Restricting the use of underground resources and fossil material,
raise the level of urban public transport systems, measures necessary to
reduce the high traffic urban, traffic correct management applied and
effective strategies to improve the quality of the auto industry
productions implement policies to reduce air pollution.

- Given that prerequisite quantification, load calculation disease
attributable to air pollution and health effects of air pollutants,
there is epidemiological indices, these indicators are calculated
specialists suggest.

- Recommended to use with this model or other models, effects of air
pollution on health of people other metropolitan country investigated
and evaluated and comparisons should be made.
