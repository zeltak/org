*Short Running Title:* Prenatal PM_{2.5} and urban childhood asthma

*Title Page*

*ABSTRACT *

*Background:* The influence of particulate air pollution on respiratory
health starts /in utero/. Fetal lung growth and structural development
occurs in stages, thus effects on postnatal respiratory disorders may
differ based on timing of exposure. We implemented an innovative method
to identify sensitive windows for effects of prenatal exposure to
particulate matter with a diameter≤2.5μm (PM_{2.5}) on children's asthma
development in an urban pregnancy cohort.

*Methods:* Analyses included 736 full-term (≥37 weeks) children. Each
mother's daily PM_{2.5} exposure was estimated over gestation using a
validated hybrid satellite-based spatio-temporal resolved model. Using
distributed lag models (DLMs), we examined associations between weekly
averaged PM_{2.5} levels over pregnancy and physician diagnosed asthma
in children by age 6 years. Effect modification by sex was also
examined.

*Results:* The majority of mothers were ethnic minority (54% Hispanic,
30% black), had ≤12 years of education (66%) and did not smoke in
pregnancy (80%). In the sample as a whole, DLMs adjusting for child age,
sex, and maternal factors (education, race/ethnicity, smoking, stress,
atopy, pre-pregnancy obesity) showed that increased PM_{2.5} exposure
levels at 16-25 weeks gestation was significantly associated with early
childhood asthma development. An interaction between PM_{2.5} and sex
was significant (p=0.01) with sex-stratified analyses showing that the
association was only evident in boys. *Conclusions:* Higher prenatal
PM_{2.5} exposure mid-gestation was associated with asthma development
by age 6 years, particularly in boys. Methods to better characterize
vulnerable windows may provide insight into underlying mechanisms.

*INTRODUCTION *

Toxic exposures in critical developmental windows may result in
permanently altered changes in respiratory and interrelated systems
(e.g., immune, autonomic, neuroendocrine) at the cellular, structural
and/or functional level that manifest in childhood disorders (e.g.,
asthma) ([[#_ENREF_1][1]], [[#_ENREF_2][2]]). The fetus is particularly
vulnerable due to immature immune, neuroendocrine and xenobiotic
detoxification systems as well as antioxidant defenses
([[#_ENREF_3][3-6]]). Prenatal development of the respiratory system is
a multi-event process progressing sequentially from early gestation
([[#_ENREF_7][7]]), thus toxins may have variable impact depending on
timing of exposure ([[#_ENREF_1][1]]).

Air pollution exposure impacts the developing respiratory system, with
evidence particularly implicating pro-oxidants such as particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM_{2.5}). Epidemiological
studies link prenatal particulate air pollution with childhood wheeze,
asthma, and altered lung function ([[#_ENREF_4][4]],
[[#_ENREF_8][8-10]]). Animal studies link prenatal PM with cytokine
disruption, increased immunoglobulin E (IgE), impaired lung growth, and
airway hyperresponsiveness in offspring ([[#_ENREF_11][11-14]]).
Gestational exposure to PM may enhance maternal systemic oxidative
stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine production ([[#_ENREF_15][15]])
resulting in placental and endothelial dysfunction, and increased fetal
oxidative stress with consequent effects on fetal immune and lung
development ([[#_ENREF_7][7]], [[#_ENREF_14][14]],
[[#_ENREF_16][16-18]]).

Human studies have not extensively elucidated sensitive windows, largely
due to variable methods for exposure assignment and lack of temporal
resolution. Epidemiological studies have historically used more crude
indices (e.g., "high polluted" vs. "low polluted" areas, levels at
closest monitor, proximity to roads, traffic density), as it is cost
prohibitive to collect repeated exposure data over pregnancy using
personal monitoring ([[#_ENREF_19][19-21]]). Thus studies have
considered relatively arbitrary assignment of exposure windows (e.g.,
averaged over pregnancy, within clinically defined trimesters, personal
monitoring at discrete time points) rather than being grounded in an
understanding of developmental processes relevant to the respiratory
system/./ As the processes involved in programming respiratory outcomes
do not necessarily occur within clinically defined trimesters and
sensitive periods remain largely unknown ([[#_ENREF_7][7]]), research
that allows flexibility in identifying sensitive windows may be
particularly informative. More recently developed approaches (e.g.,
spatio-temporal land-use regression [LUR], multi-scale air quality
deterministic chemistry models, etc.) for deriving spatio-temporally
resolved exposure profiles ([[#_ENREF_22][22-24]]) allow researchers to
estimate exposure patterns at a higher temporal resolution.

Overlapping animal and human research suggest that prenatal air
pollution exposure may have sex-specific effects. Animal studies
demonstrate sex difference in lung growth and airway development
([[#_ENREF_25][25]], [[#_ENREF_26][26]]). In humans, females display
earlier fetal breathing and surfactant production, that may in part be
the basis for the reduction in forced expiratory flow rates that
predispose males to airway diseases in early childhood
([[#_ENREF_27][27]], [[#_ENREF_28][28]]). Prenatal air pollution induces
fetal oxidative stress ([[#_ENREF_29][29]]), and in turn influences gene
expression and physiologic events crucial for lung maturation
([[#_ENREF_30][30]]). Boys may be more vulnerable to prenatal oxidant
injury ([[#_ENREF_31][31]]) and thus may have an exaggerated response to
/in utero/ air pollution exposure.

In order to address these research gaps, we leveraged daily prenatal
PM_{2.5} measures available over pregnancy and applied advanced
statistical methods [e.g., distributed lag models (DLMs)] to more
precisely identify sensitive windows in relation to childhood asthma
onset by age 6 years in an ethnically mixed lower-SES urban pregnancy
cohort. Effect modification by sex was also examined. Findings from
these analyses were presented at the 2014 American Thoracic Society
International Conference ([[#_ENREF_32][32]]).

*METHODS*

Participants were from the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment
and Social Stress (ACCESS) project, a pregnancy cohort designed to
examine the effects of perinatal exposure to physical toxins and
psychosocial stress on urban childhood respiratory health
([[#_ENREF_33][33]]). In brief, English- or Spanish-speaking pregnant
women (≥18 years old) receiving care at Brigham & Women's Hospital
(BWH), Boston Medical Center (BMC), and affiliated community health
centers were enrolled at 28.4±7.9 weeks gestation between August 2002
and July 2009. Among pregnant women approached who were eligible, 989
(78.1%) agreed to enroll. Based on screening data, there were no
significant differences for race/ethnicity, education, and income
between participants who enrolled and those who declined. Of those
enrolled, 915 gave birth to a singleton live born infant and continued
follow-up. Procedures were approved by human studies committees at the
Brigham and Women's Hospital and Boston Medical Center; written consent
was obtained in the subject's primary language.

/*Daily Prenatal PM_{2.5} Levels* /

Mothers' prenatal exposure to PM_{2.5}, an index of ambient pollution
from traffic and other sources, was estimated based on residence over
the pregnancy (i.e., at enrollment and updated if they moved) using a
novel hybrid spatio-temporal model incorporating Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-derived Aerosol Optical
Depth (AOD) measurements at a 10 x 10 km spatial resolution and
traditional LUR predictors to yield residence-specific estimates of
daily PM_{2.5} as detailed previously ([[#_ENREF_22][22]]). The model
was run using day-specific calibrations of AOD data using ground
PM_{2.5} measurements from 78 monitoring stations across New England and
LUR and meteorological variables (temperature, wind speed, visibility,
elevation, distance to major roads, percent open space, point emissions
and area emissions). This approach incorporates highly resolved spatial
information from the LUR data and important spatio-temporal data from
the remote sensing satellite data. The AOD-PM_{2.5} relationship was
calibrated for each day using data from grid cells with both monitor and
AOD values using mixed models with random slopes for day, nested within
region. For days without AOD data (due to cloud coverage, snow, etc.),
the model was fit with a smooth function of latitude and longitude and a
random intercept for each cell (similar to universal kriging). The “out
of sample” ten-fold cross validation R^{2} for daily values were 0.83
and 0.81 for days with and without available AOD data, respectively. To
reduce potential noise caused by day-to-day PM_{2.5} variation, daily
levels were averaged into weekly exposure profiles. Predicted overall
prenatal PM_{2.5} levels at participant's residence in relation to the
10x10 km grids for which AOD data were available are shown in Figure 1.
While levels were higher around major roadways as anticipated, there was
reasonable heterogeneity.

/*Asthma*/

Maternal-reported clinician-diagnosed asthma was ascertained from birth
up to age 6 years through telephone and face-to-face interviews at
approximately 3-month intervals for the first 24 months then annually
thereafter. Mothers were asked, “Has a doctor or nurse ever said that
your child had asthma?”.

/*Covariates* /

Maternal age, race, education and pre-pregnancy height and weight, and
child's sex were ascertained by questionnaire; date of birth,
gestational age, and birth weight were obtained by medical record
review. A validation analysis on a subset of 121 ACCESS women showed no
difference in the level of agreement/disagreement for height and weight
when comparing values measured early in pregnancy (<10 weeks) to
self-report ([[#_ENREF_34][34]]). Women were asked about smoking at
enrollment and in the third trimester and classified as prenatal smokers
if smoking at either visit. Mothers reported postnatal smoking and
whether others smoked in the home at each postpartum interview. Maternal
atopy was defined by self-reported doctor-diagnosed asthma, eczema,
and/or hay fever. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing
weight by height squared (kg/m^{2}); obesity was defined as BMI≥30
kg/m^{2} ([[#_ENREF_35][35]]). As prenatal stress may co-vary with
pollution and has been associated with asthma ([[#_ENREF_36][36]]), this
was also considered as a confounder. We measured stress using the Crisis
in Family Systems-Revised survey (CRYSIS-R) administered prenatally
within two weeks of enrollment ([[#_ENREF_37][37]], [[#_ENREF_38][38]]).
This survey assesses life events experienced across 11 domains (e.g.,
financial, relationships, violence, housing, discrimination/prejudice).
Mothers endorsed events experienced in the past six months and rated
each as positive, negative, or neutral. The number of domains with one
or more negative event was summed to create a continuous negative life
events (NLEs) domain score, with higher scores indicating greater
stress. Because birth weight and gestational age may be on the pathway
between prenatal PM and asthma risk, the birth weight for gestational
age z-score ([[#_ENREF_39][39]]) was considered in sensitivity analyses.

/*Statistical Analysis */

Analyses included 736 singleton full-term (gestational age ≥37 weeks)
children with two or more postnatal interviews followed up to age 6
years and air pollution exposure data. In order to explore sensitive
windows, we constructed an exposure lag space ([[#_ENREF_40][40]])
incorporating weekly averages of daily PM_{2.5} predictions at each
subject's residence throughout the gestational period. We fit
distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the time-varying association
between the probability of child's asthma onset and the estimated
PM_{2.5} level during a given week in pregnancy. Specifically, we fit
the logistic regression DLM:

$\text{\ logit}\left( \pi_{i} \right) = \beta_{0} + \sum_{j = 1}^{n}{\lbrack\alpha_{j}\text{AP}_{\text{ij}}\rbrack}{+ \beta}_{1}x_{1i} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{pi}$,
where $\pi_{i}$ is the probability of a report of clinician diagnosed
asthma, $AP_{\text{ij}}$ is the estimated PM_{2.5} level for week j of
pregnancy, and $x_{1i}$, ..., $x_{\text{pi}}$ confounders for subject i.
Models included maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy
obesity, pre/postnatal tobacco smoke exposure, prenatal NLEs, and
child's sex. Without additional structure on the $\alpha_{j}$
coefficients, the estimates of the week-specific effects are typically
unstable due to collinearity among the weekly pollution averages.
Therefore, we fit constrained DLMs that assumes these effects
$\alpha_{j}$ are a smooth function of j (week), such $\alpha_{j}$ =
h(j). We modeled this smooth function using b-splines. A sensitive
window was identified when the pointwise 95% confidence bands did not
contain zero. Next, to assess whether the sensitive window of prenatal
PM_{2.5} exposure on childhood asthma onset was different between boys
and girls, sex-stratified DLMs were performed, adjusting for maternal
age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy obesity, pre/postnatal
smoking status, and prenatal NLEs. We then constructed a difference
curve by subtracting the effect estimates of the DLM curve for the girls
from the effect estimates of the DLM curve for the boys [(log odds of
boys) -- (log odds of girls)], and calculated the associated pooled
standard error to derive the 95% CI of the difference curve. For
additional sensitivity analyses, we also examined sex-specific
associations between prenatal PM_{2.5} levels averaged across the
DLM-identified sensitive windows using multivariable-adjusted linear
regression models, as well as fitting the interaction model using the
following equation: logit(asthma) = intercept + β_{1} (female ×
PM_{2.5}) + β_{2} (male) + β_{3} (male × PM_{2.5}) + β_{4} /x_{1i}/ +
β_{5} /x_{2i}/ + ... + /ε_{i}/, where /x_{1i}/, /x_{2i}/... are
covariates. Finally, because prenatal and postnatal PM_{2.5} levels were
correlated (Spearman's /r/=0.82), we performed sensitivity analyses by
including postnatal PM_{2.5} levels in the models. We also fit models
including birth weight adjusted for gestational age. DLMs were
implemented using the /dlnm/ package in /R/ (version 3.0.1, Vienna,
Austria) ([[#_ENREF_40][40]]), and other analyses were performed in SAS
(version 9.1.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

*RESULTS*

Most mothers were ethnic minority (54% Hispanic, 30% African American),
had ≤ 12 years of education (66%), and did not smoke in pregnancy (80%);
the distribution of these covariates did not differ by sex (Table 1).
There were also no significant sex difference in terms of gestational
age at birth, maternal age, atopy, obesity, prenatal stress and PM_{2.5}
exposure. Boys were more likely to be diagnosed with asthma compared to
girls (18% versus 12%; χ^{2} test /p/=0.02). Birth weight for
gestational age z-score was significantly lower in girls than boys
(Wilcoxon rank-sum test /p/=0.003).

/*Distributed Lag Models (DLMs) */

Figure 2 shows the association between prenatal PM_{2.5} and children's
asthma onset using DLMs, adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity,
education, pre-pregnancy obesity, pre/postnatal tobacco smoke exposure,
prenatal NLEs, and child's sex. We observed a significant sensitive
window of PM_{2.5} exposure around mid-pregnancy on asthma onset by age
6 years; specifically, during 16-25 weeks gestation (Figure 2).
Sensitivity analyses additionally including averaged postnatal PM_{2.5}
levels and birth weight adjusted for gestational age did not materially
change these results (data not shown).

Figure 3 demonstrates the sex-specific association between prenatal
PM_{2.5} and children's asthma onset using DLMs, adjusting for maternal
age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy obesity, pre/postnatal
tobacco smoke exposure, and prenatal NLEs. When stratified by sex, we
observed a significant sensitive exposure window between 12-26 weeks
gestation among boys but not girls (Figure 3). In order to examine the
interaction between prenatal PM_{2.5} and sex, we also constructed a DLM
demonstrating the difference between boys and girls; the difference
curve showed that associations were significantly stronger in boys from
14-20 weeks gestation compared to girls (Figure 4). Finally, we fit a
multivariable logistic regression model including a PM_{2.5} × sex
interaction term using PM_{2.5} level averaged over this identified
sensitive window, and found a significant interaction between PM_{2.5}
and sex (p-value=0.01).

*DISCUSSION *

These data add to a growing literature linking prenatal particulate air
pollution exposure to children's respiratory health. This is the first
study to leverage weekly PM_{2.5} exposure estimates over gestation
combined with data driven statistics to characterize susceptibility
windows, removing the subjectivity that currently guides the decision of
when to assess exposure effects. These data demonstrate that increased
prenatal PM_{2.5} exposure in mid-gestation (16-25 weeks gestation) was
associated with development of childhood asthma in these urban children,
particularly among boys. More refined estimation of the time window in
which air pollution has the greatest impact may provide insights into
underlying mechanisms as well as the etiology of sex-specific effects.

While previous studies link higher prenatal exposure to PM with adverse
pulmonary outcomes such as asthma ([[#_ENREF_41][41-43]]), the sensitive
window with the greatest impact has not been well elucidated. A more
definitive understanding of the temporal effects of toxins on outcomes
in the offspring may provide clues as to the underlying mechanisms being
perturbed based on our current understanding of the cellular
differentiation, proliferation, or physiological function changes
occurring progressively over pregnancy. This study demonstrates the
applicability of advanced statistical modeling to illustrate the pattern
of associations throughout the pregnancy based on the data /per se/
rather than assigning /a priori/ exposure time points relevant to our
exposure of interest. The identified sensitive window coincides with the
late pseudoglandular and canalicular phases of fetal lung development
([[#_ENREF_7][7]]). A number of essential tissues and their functions
are shaped during these lung development phases. During the
pseudoglandular stage (5-17 weeks), the conducting airways develop,
smooth muscle and mucous glands form, and acinar outlines appear
([[#_ENREF_44][44]]). The airways continue to develop during the
canalicular stage (17-26 weeks) and capillaries, thin-walled terminal
saccules, and alveolar epithelium begin to appear. Type II cells may
undergo differentiation to Type I cells in this period, with subsequent
surfactant production ([[#_ENREF_7][7]], [[#_ENREF_42][42]],
[[#_ENREF_45][45]]). For example, the airway epithelium, formed during
the canalicular phase, can secrete an array of innate immune molecules
implicated in reactive airway disorders such as asthma
([[#_ENREF_46][46]]). Specifically, the airway epithelium may be a major
source of IL-25, which regulates immune-mediated inflammatory airway
diseases and the response to infections, as well as IL-33 and thymic
stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which also influence asthma development
([[#_ENREF_47][47]]). Moreover, recent studies have found that
epithelial barrier, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and mesenchymal
phenotype are associated with lung function and allergic pulmonary
diseases over the life course ([[#_ENREF_47][47-50]]). Factors involved
in airway epithelial function and migration have been increasingly
implicated in the links between PM, impaired lung growth and asthma risk
([[#_ENREF_51][51]], [[#_ENREF_52][52]]).

Previous human studies have suggested that sex differences in lung
development may be related to differential maturation in males relative
to females in terms of surfactant synthesis, airway size, and airway
resistance, which also begin during the late pseudoglandular and
canalicular phases ([[#_ENREF_28][28]], [[#_ENREF_53][53]]). Fetal
breathing, a critical determinant of lung development, and surfactant
production occur earlier in females as compared to males
([[#_ENREF_54][54]], [[#_ENREF_55][55]]). Sex-differences result in
lower specific airway resistance and higher size-corrected flow rates
and specific airway conductance in female infants
([[#_ENREF_56][56-59]]) and predispose male infants to childhood
respiratory diseases including asthma ([[#_ENREF_60][60]],
[[#_ENREF_61][61]]). Infant males, therefore, may have a pulmonary
phenotype more susceptible to the deleterious effects of prenatal air
pollution exposure. Moreover, a leading mechanism underlying the link
between prenatal PM_{2.5} exposure and childhood asthma is thought to
involve oxidative stress pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokine
production ([[#_ENREF_15][15]], [[#_ENREF_62][62]]). The developing
fetus is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress as fetal
antioxidant capabilities do not increase until the third trimester.
Murine models of oxidative stress at embryonic day 16, equivalent to the
canalicular phase in human lung development, demonstrate reductions in
peripheral airway number, branching complexity and alveolarization
([[#_ENREF_63][63]]). This coupled with evidence to support an increased
susceptibility of the male fetus to maternal oxidative stress
([[#_ENREF_31][31]]) may contribute to the observed greater risk in
males. It is also possible that the anti-oxidant properties of female
sex hormones ([[#_ENREF_64][64]], [[#_ENREF_65][65]]) may mitigate
damaging effects of prenatal ambient PM exposure. Future studies are
needed to corroborate our findings and further examine these mechanisms
to better understand observed sex differences.

We note several strengths of this study. We assessed prenatal maternal
daily particulate air pollution using a validated state-of-the-art
hybrid spatio-temporal LUR model incorporating satellite-derived Aerosol
Optical Depth measures based on mothers' residence during pregnancy. We
then leveraged these exposure estimates to implement a data driven,
advanced statistical method to objectively identify susceptibility
windows for PM. Also, our study population consists of a lower-SES
ethnically mixed inner-city cohort that may be more highly exposed to
ambient pollution as well as being at greater risk for asthma. Finally,
this is the first study to examine sex-specific effects of prenatal
particulate air pollution on childhood asthma development. We also
acknowledge some limitations. While we were able to control for several
factors known to be important in children's asthma development, we did
not have data on dietary and other environmental factors that may
co-vary with air pollution such as temperature. In addition, children's
doctor-diagnosed asthma was reported by mothers using questionnaires.
Further studies may therefore consider sex-specific joint or interactive
associations among additional environmental factors. As we follow this
cohort it will be informative to see if similar associations hold for
other measures of respiratory function (e.g., spirometry, airway
reactivity). Finally, while we focused on a higher-risk sample, our
results may not be generalizable to the overall U.S. population.

In summary, we demonstrate that advanced statistical methods when
combined with highly temporally resolved exposure data can identify
susceptibility windows to environmental exposures that may enhance our
ability to find effects and identify vulnerable groups. Increased PM
exposure around mid-gestation may be particularly relevant to childhood
asthma development, especially among boys. A more definitive
characterization of vulnerable windows may provide insight into
underlying mechanisms when coupled with our understanding of lung
growth, airway structural and functional development, and asthma
pathophysiology.

*Figure 1. Predicted PM_{2.5} levels for ACCESS participants during
pregnancy *

This figure demonstrates predicted PM_{2.5} levels for study
participants based on residence during the gestation period. The 10km x
10km AOD grid used to predict daily PM_{2.5} levels is also depicted.

*Figure 2.* *Association between weekly PM_{2.5} levels over gestation
and asthma onset *

This figure demonstrates the association between PM_{2.5} over gestation
and asthma onset by age 6 years using a distributed lag model (DLM)
assuming week-specific effects, adjusting for child's sex, maternal age
at enrollment, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy obesity,
prenatal and postnatal smoking, and prenatal stress. The Y Axis shows
the odds ratio (OR) of asthma in relation to a 10 μg/m^{3} increase in
prenatal PM_{2.5} exposure; the X axis depicts gestational age in weeks.
The solid line shows the predicted OR and the gray area indicates the
95% confidence intervals (CIs). A sensitive window is identified when
the estimated pointwise 95% CI does not include zero.

*Figure 3.* *Association between weekly PM_{2.5} levels over gestation
and asthma onset *

This figure demonstrates the association between PM_{2.5} over gestation
and asthma onset by age 6 years using distributed lag models (DLMs)
assuming week-specific effects, stratified by sex. The models adjusted
for maternal age at enrollment, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy
obesity, prenatal and postnatal smoking status, and prenatal stress. The
Y Axis shows the odds ratio (OR) of asthma in relation to a 10 μg/m^{3}
increase in prenatal PM_{2.5} exposure; the X axis depicts gestational
age in weeks. The solid line shows the predicted OR and the gray area
indicates the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A sensitive window is
identified when the estimated pointwise 95% CI does not include zero.

*Figure 4.* *Association between weekly PM_{2.5} levels over gestation
and the difference in asthma onset between boys and girls *

This figure demonstrates the association between PM_{2.5} over gestation
and the difference in asthma onset between sex using a distributed lag
model (DLM) assuming week-specific effects, adjusting for maternal age
at enrollment, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy obesity,
prenatal and postnatal smoking status, and prenatal stress. The Y Axis
shows the differences in log odds of asthma between boys and girls [(log
odds of boys) -- (log odds of girls)] in relation to a 10 μg/m^{3}
increase in prenatal PM_{2.5} exposure; the X axis is gestational age in
weeks. The solid line shows the predicted odds ratio and the gray area
indicates the 95% CIs.
