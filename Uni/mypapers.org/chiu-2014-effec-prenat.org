*ABSTRACT* /(Abstract word count: 249)/

*Background:* Mothers' prenatal exposures to psychosocial stress and
physical toxins influence children's respiratory health, albeit few
studies consider these factors together. *Objectives:* To concurrently
examine the effects of prenatal community-level psychosocial (exposure
to community violence, ECV) and physical (ambient air pollution) toxins
on repeated wheeze in 708 urban children followed to age 2 years.
*Methods:* Multi-item ECV was reported by mothers at mid-to-late
pregnancy and summarized into a continuous score. We estimated
individual prenatal exposure to black carbon (BC) using land-use
regression (LUR) modeling and particulate matter (PM_{2.5}) combining
LUR and satellite modeling. Mothers reported child's wheeze every 3
months. We examined effects of ECV and air pollutants on repeated wheeze
(≥2 episodes) using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression.
Interactions between ECV and pollutants were examined. *Results:*
Mothers were primarily Black (29%) and Hispanic (55%) with lower
education (62% with ≤12 years); 87 children (12%) had repeated wheeze.
In models examining concurrent exposures, ECV [odds ratio (OR) 1.95 (95%
CI: 1.13-3.36), highest vs. lowest tertile] and BC [OR 1.84 (95% CI:
1.08-3.12), ≥median vs. <median BC] were independently associated with
wheeze adjusting for gender, season of birth, maternal atopy, education,
race, and cockroach antigen. Associations were similar when considering
PM_{2.5} as the pollution indicator. An additive interaction between
higher ECV with more modest BC levels was suggested (/p/=0.08).
*Conclusions:* Prenatal ECV and traffic-related air pollution were
independently associated with repeated wheeze. Place-based psychosocial
stressors may impact host resistance such that physical pollutants may
have adverse effects, even at relatively lower levels.

*Key words:* community violence, prenatal, stress, repeated wheeze,
ambient air pollution

*INTRODUCTION*

The increased burden of wheezing respiratory illnesses and asthma in
lower-socioeconomic status (SES) urban communities may, in part, be
explained by differential environmental exposures, including
psychosocial stressors and physical toxins, which cluster in more
socially disadvantaged communities. Candidate factors receiving
increasing attention include community violence and ambient air
pollution.

Studies link community violence with increased asthma prevalence, higher
hospitalization rates for asthma, more symptom days, and increased risk
of wheezing in 2-3year olds. Higher lifetime community violence exposure
was associated with increased childhood asthma risk in a prospective,
multi-level analysis adjusted for individual-level factors (e.g., SES,
race, smoking) and neighborhood indicators (neighborhood disadvantage,
social disorder, collective efficacy). While various mechanisms may
underlie this association, a leading framework conceptualizes community
violence as a chronic psychological stressor taxing individuals living
in high-risk communities. Effects of maternal stress on respiratory
outcomes may begin in pregnancy, although prenatal community violence
has not been studied specifically.

Studies link ambient air pollution exposure in childhood to respiratory
morbidity including asthma and lung development. Evidence suggests a
role for particulate and other traffic-related components (e.g., black
carbon) in particular.. More recent studies link air pollution exposure
during pregnancy, including fine particulate matter and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, with wheeze, lower respiratory infections, and
reduced lung function in children.

Studies including concurrent measures of the psychosocial and physical
environmental factors that may co-vary in urban, lower-SES communities
are needed to assess whether they have independent effects on child
respiratory health versus whether an adverse social environment is
confounded by increased physical toxins in the environment. Moreover,
co-occurring psychosocial and physical exposures may combine to
influence or modify respiratory health risk (i.e., cumulative effects).
Studies examining interactions between chronic stress and air pollution
exposures on asthma expression remain sparse and have focused on older
children or adolescents.

We examined the effects of both prenatal maternal exposure to community
violence (ECV), a neighborhood-level stressor, and ambient air
pollutants [black carbon (BC), a surrogate of traffic particles, and
ambient particulate matter (PM_{2.5})] on repeated wheeze risk in urban
children followed up to 2 years, adjusting for sociodemographics, health
behaviors, and potential confounders. We also examined the joint or
interactive effects of prenatal ECV and air pollution exposures on
wheeze. We hypothesized that there would be independent effects of ECV
and ambient pollutants on child wheeze and that those children born to
mothers with higher exposure to both ECV and ambient pollutants would be
more likely to wheeze compared with children born to mothers with low
exposure to both factors.

*MATERIALS AND METHODS*

Participants were from a pregnancy cohort examining independent and
interactive effects of early life psychosocial stress and physical
toxins on urban childhood asthma risk. In brief, English- or
Spanish-speaking pregnant women (/>/18 years old) receiving care at
Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH), Boston Medical Center (BMC), and
affiliated clinics were enrolled mid-to-late pregnancy (mean±SD of
gestation = 28.4±7.9 weeks) between August 2002 and December 2009. Among
women approached, 989 of those who were eligible (78.1%) agreed to
enroll. There were no significant differences on race/ethnicity,
education, and income between women enrolled and those who declined. Of
these, 955 gave birth to a live born infant and continued follow-up.
Procedures were approved by the human studies committees at BWH and BMC.
Written consent was obtained in the participants' primary language.

/*Exposure to Community Violence (ECV):*/ Within two weeks of
enrollment, mothers completed the My Exposure to Violence questionnaire
assessing hearing gunshots, witnessing and/or experiencing fights, knife
attacks, and/or shootings in their neighborhood. Acceptable internal
consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity have been described.
Events reported in the past year indicated exposure proximate to and
during the pregnancy hereafter termed prenatal ECV. The multi-item
survey was summarized into a continuous scale using Rasch modeling with
higher scores indicating greater severity of violence exposure (e.g.,
witnessing a knifing or shooting compared to pushing or shoving fights)
as well as greater frequency.

/*Air Pollution:*/ Prenatal exposure to BC was estimated based on
residence over the pregnancy (i.e., enrollment and updated if they
moved) using validated spatio-temporal land-use regression (LUR) models
as detailed elsewhere. In brief, the BC model was built using data of
24-hr measures of BC based on >6021 pollution measurements from >2079
unique exposure days at 82 monitoring locations in greater Boston
(three-quarters residential, one-quarter commercial or governmental
sites). Predictions were based on meteorological and other
characteristics e.g. weekday/weekend) of a particular day, geographic
information system (GIS)-based measures [e.g., traffic density within
100 meters (m), population density, distance to major roadway, percent
urbanization), and BC levels measured from a central monitor
(representing overall area concentration on a particular day). The
cumulative traffic density was recorded once per location, indicating
the sum of traffic counts on all road segments within 100 meters
multiplied by the length of each road segment. Spline regression methods
were used to allow factors to nonlinearly predict exposure and
thin-plate splines captured additional spatial variability. Separate
models were fit for the cold (November-April) and warm (May-October)
seasons; the R^{2} of the model over both seasons was 0.82. The
locations of major roadways, monitoring sites, participants' residences,
and the heterogeneity of the predicted BC levels are shown in Figure 1.

Prenatal PM_{2.5} exposure was estimated by using a novel exposure model
developed recently for assessing temporally-and spatially-resolved
PM_{2.5} exposures for epidemiological studies, as detailed elsewhere.
This method utilizes MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer) satellite-derived AOD measurements to predict daily
PM_{2.5} concentration levels at a 10 x 10 km spatial resolution since
2000 across New England. As the model is based on daily physical
measurements of a surrogate for PM_{2.5} concentrations in each grid
cell, it benefits both from the spatial resolution of LUR models and the
spatio-temporal resolution of satellite models. The model was run using
day-specific calibrations of AOD data using ground PM_{2.5} measurements
from 78 monitoring stations and land use regression and meteorological
variables (temperature, wind speed, visibility, elevation, distance to
major roads, percent of open space, point emissions and area emissions).
To estimate PM_{2.5} concentrations in each grid cell on each day, the
AOD-PM_{2.5} relationship was calibrated for each day using data from
grid cells with both monitor and AOD values using mixed models with
random slopes for day and nested regions. A second model was used to
estimate exposures on days when AOD measures were not available (due to
cloud coverage, snow, etc.). The model was fit with a smooth function of
latitude and longitude and a random intercept for each cell (similar to
universal kriging) that takes advantage of associations between grid
cell AOD values and PM_{2.5} data from monitors located elsewhere, and
associations with available AOD values in neighboring grid cells. The
“out of sample” ten folds cross validation R^{2} for daily values was
0.83 and 0.81 for days with and without available AOD data,
respectively.

*Children's Repeated Wheeze *

At approximately 3-month intervals starting from birth,
maternal-reported wheeze in children was ascertained up to age 24 months
through interviews. Mothers were asked, “Since we last spoke with you on
(date), has your infant/child had wheezing or whistling in the chest?”.
Two or more episodes constituted repeated wheeze. Of the 708 children,
449 (63.4%) never wheezed, 172 (24.3%) wheezed once, and 50 (7.1%), 25
(3.5%), 10 (1.4%), and 2 (0.3%) had 2, 3, 4, and 5 wheeze episodes,
respectively.

*Covariates*

Maternal age, race, educational status, history of atopy (ever having
clinician-diagnosed asthma, eczema, and/or hay fever), and pre-pregnancy
height and weight were ascertained by self-report at enrollment; child's
gender, season of birth, and birthweight were reported postnatally.
Maternal body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by
height squared (kg/m^{2}). Given complex patterns of prenatal smoking,
we asked about smoking during the pregnancy at baseline and in the third
trimester; women were classified as smokers if they reported smoking at
either visit. Mothers reported postnatal smoking and whether others
smoked in the home at each 3-month postpartum interview.

Lower-SES populations exposed to higher violence and pollution may also
be exposed to increased household allergens. Settled dust was collected
within 2 weeks of enrollment from the mother's bedroom using a
standardized protocol. Cockroach allergens (/Blatella Germanica, Bla g
1/ and /Bla g 2/) were analyzed using a monoclonal antibody-based
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (mAB ELISA) (Indoor Biotechnologies,
Charlottesville, Va). High exposure was defined as Bla g 1 and/or Bla g
2 >2 U/g.

*Analysis*

Those completing two or more postnatal interviews up to 24 months for
whom air pollution indicators were derived were included in the analyses
(/n/=708 mother-child pairs). Characteristics of included (maternal age
27±6 years, 62% with ≤ high school education, 29% Blacks, 55% Hispanics,
52% boys) versus excluded subjects (maternal age 26±5 years, 64% with ≤
high school education, 38% Blacks, 48% Hispanics, 53% boys) were not
significantly different. Missingness on covariates was approximately 5%,
thus missing indicators were used in multivariate analyses.

The prenatal ECV score (range: -0.68 to 3.53) was categorized as low,
medium, and high using cutoffs at the 33^{rd} and 67^{th} percentile to
enhance interpretability and address potential non-linearity. Given
ties, low (n=358), medium (n=149), and high (n=201) categories were
unequal. Ambient pollution indicators (BC, PM_{2.5}) were /a priori/
categorized into “high” and “low” groups based on a median split as
there is no established health-relevant cutoff. To evaluate the
independent effects of prenatal ECV and air pollution on child repeated
wheeze, we performed multivariate logistic regressions including both in
the same model and then adjusted for child's gender, maternal
demographic variables previously correlated with community violence and
pollution exposures (e.g., maternal race/ethnicity, education level),
atopy-related factors (season of birth, maternal atopy), and cockroach
allergen exposure. BC and PM_{2.5} were considered separately. Variables
that may be in the pathway between ECV and/or pollution were also
considered, including maternal BMI, pre- and postnatal tobacco smoke
exposure, and child's birthweight adjusting for gestational age . To
ensure these results were not affected by the chosen ECV and air
pollutant cutpoints, we also explored exposure-response relationships
using continuous indicators by implementing Generalized Additive Models
(GAMs) with smooth penalized spline terms.

In stratified analyses, we examined effect modification on the
association between prenatal ECV and children's repeated wheeze by
ambient pollutant level. We also fit interaction terms of ECV by median
split BC or PM_{2.5} to examine effects on both the multiplicative and
additive scales. The former was examined by including a product term
between ECV and pollution levels. The latter was examined by calculating
the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI; RERI=0 indicates no
interaction on an additive scale); confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated using the first bootstrap percentile method. GAMs were
implemented using the MGCV package in R (version 2.13.0, Vienna,
Austria). SAS (version 9.1.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for
other analyses.

*RESULTS*

Most mothers were ethnic minority (55% Hispanic, 29% African American),
low SES (62% having ≤ 12 years of education), and nonsmokers (80%); 87
children (12%) had repeated wheeze (Table 1). Spearman's correlations
between ECV and pollutants were modest (Table 2).

/*ECV, Air Pollution,*/ /*and Wheeze */

Table 3 summarizes logistic regression models. The ORs for repeated
wheeze comparing high and medium to low prenatal ECV groups suggested an
exposure-response relationship, in both the univariate model and when
adjusted for prenatal BC or PM_{2.5} levels. Effects of BC and PM_{2.5}
were borderline nonsignificant in unadjusted models. In the model
adjusting for sociodemographics, atopy, and cockroach exposure, the
highest level of prenatal ECV remained significantly associated with
repeated wheeze, and higher-level air pollution exposures (both BC and
PM_{2.5}) were now also significantly related to wheeze. Further
inclusion of potential pathway variables (e.g. maternal smoking, BMI,
and gestational-age-adjusted birthweight) did not alter these findings
(data not shown). Other significant predictors of repeated wheeze
included male gender and maternal atopy. Results from the GAMs for the
continuous ECV score and air pollution indicators supported linear
exposure-response relationships (Figure 2).

/*Stratified Analyses */

In stratified analyses, we observed significant associations between
high prenatal ECV and increased repeated wheeze in the low BC (adjusted
OR=2.87, 95% CI: 1.33-7.32) and low PM_{2.5} groups (adjusted OR=3.63,
95% CI: 1.43-9.52) but not in the high BC (adjusted OR=1.31, 95% CI:
0.59-2.93) or high PM_{2.5} groups (adjusted OR=1.51, 95% CI: 0.71-3.21)
(Figure 3), albeit multiplicative interactions were not significant
(p>0.20 for both). The RERI for high ECV by low BC was 0.26 (95% CI:
-0.09, 1.83; /p/=0.08), indicating that the OR for repeated wheeze in
those with high ECV and low BC is 0.26 more than if there were no
interaction on the additive scale. The additive interaction between ECV
and PM_{2.5} was not significant (p=0.33)

*DISCUSSION*

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to concurrently
assess associations between prenatal exposure to neighborhood-level
psychosocial (i.e., community violence) and physical toxins (i.e.,
ambient pollution) in relationship to early childhood wheeze. Children
born to mothers reporting higher levels of community violence exposure
prenatally were more likely to have repeated wheeze, even when adjusting
for a number of child (i.e., gender, season of birth, birthweight) and
maternal (i.e., race, education, BMI, atopic history) factors, as well
as other environmental factors (i.e., ambient BC and PM_{2.5}, cockroach
allergen, maternal smoking). Moreover, in models considering ECV and the
air pollution indicators together, BC and PM_{2.5} independently
predicted increased repeated wheeze in these urban children. These
findings suggest that an adverse psychosocial environment (community
violence) is not simply a surrogate of a more toxic physical environment
(e.g., increased traffic-related pollution), or vice versa. Rather, both
contribute to respiratory health in these urban children.

These data add to growing evidence linking community violence to
childhood respiratory health. Previous studies have suggested an
association between community violence assessed postnatally (i.e.,
during the child's lifetime) and heightened respiratory morbidity. Berz
and colleagues found an association between witnessing violence in the
community or home and increased repeated wheeze by age 2-3 years,
adjusting for gender, maternal asthma, smoking and social support.
Increased neighborhood violence exposure was associated with more
symptom days among 9-12 year old asthmatics , elevated asthma prevalence
in early- to middle-school aged children , and reduced lung function at
age 6 years . Recently, we demonstrated a prospective association
between higher lifetime community violence exposure and childhood asthma
risk adjusting for sociodemographics, smoking, domestic violence,
neighborhood disadvantage, social disorder and collective efficacy . The
current study is the first to consider prenatal exposure to community
violence in relation to children's respiratory health.

Previous studies have also found that exposure to traffic-related air
pollution during early childhood (i.e., postnatally) may be associated
with children's asthmatic symptoms and reduced lung function , whereas
fewer studies have focused on air pollution exposures during the
prenatal period. Thus, the independent effect of prenatal ambient
pollution exposure on early childhood wheeze adjusting for prenatal
community violence and other covariates is another important finding in
this study.

Furthermore, evidence suggests that psychosocial and physical pollutants
may combine to affect health. A few studies have assessed interactions
between stress and traffic-related air pollutants and respiratory health
showing cumulative impact. A study of early school-aged children (aged
5-9 years) suggested a stronger association between traffic-related
pollution and new onset asthma risk among children of parents reporting
higher perceived stress. Our group found that traffic-related nitrogen
dioxide (NO_{2}) based on a LUR model interacted with violence exposure
to predict increased asthma risk in urban children (mean age 6.8 years);
those with both high pollution and violence exposures were at greatest
risk. Another study of asthmatic children aged 9-18 years by Chen et al.
found that the association between higher family stress and asthma
exacerbations was stronger when NO_{2} levels derived using a LUR model
were more modest. Similar to Chen and colleagues, we observed that the
association between higher prenatal community violence exposure and
repeated wheeze was stronger in children born to mothers with more
modest prenatal air pollution exposures. Stratified analyses
demonstrated that mothers reporting higher levels of violence in their
neighborhood who were exposed to BC and PM_{2.5} below the median level
were more likely to have children with repeated wheeze when compare to
mothers exposed to low ECV at the same level of pollution. One possible
explanation is that the effect of prenatal traffic-related air pollution
on wheeze in these infants might be of significant magnitude to lead to
a saturation effect, i.e., the additional risk conferred by prenatal ECV
beyond the highest level of air pollution exposure could not be
detected. It is worth noting that the studies mentioned above varied on
key aspects [e.g., how stress and air pollution were measured,
children's developmental stage (prenatal, early childhood, adolescence)]
making it challenging to compare results more directly across studies.
Nonetheless, these data add support to the hypothesis that place-based
psychosocial stressors may impact host resistance such that physical
pollutants may have adverse effects, even at relatively lower levels.
The small sample size in the stratified groups may account for the
borderline nonsignificant (p=0.08) additive interaction for BC and ECV.
More research in larger samples is needed to further elucidate potential
interactive effects between stressors such as violence in these urban
communities and ambient pollution in relation to childhood respiratory
morbidity.

Prenatal exposure to psychosocial stress and ambient pollutants may
impact anatomy and/or physiological functioning of the lung and
interrelated systems. Programming effects may result from toxin-induced
shifts in key regulatory systems including both central and peripheral
components of neuroendocrine pathways and autonomic nervous system (ANS)
functioning which, in turn, influence the immune system starting /in
utero/. Environmental factors, including air pollutants and stress, may
permanently organize these systems toward trajectories of enhanced
pediatric disease risk (e.g., asthma, reduced lung function). These
factors may operate through incompletely overlapping mechanisms
described below that thus result in independent as well as cumulative
(interactive) effects.

For example, prenatal stress may disrupt maternal physiology [e.g.,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), sympathetic-adrenal-medullary
system], which then may potentiate the developing fetal immune system
(e.g., by upregulating maternal and feto-placental Th2 cytokine
production). Among various stress domains, traumatic stressors such as
community violence may be more likely to result in lasting biobehavioral
sequelae in the mothers (e.g., psychopathology, neurohormonal
disruption) and intergenerational effects compared with other stressor
types. Evidence suggests community violence exposure is an independent
predictor of anxiety and depression in urban minority women of
childbearing age and links community violence and its psychological
correlates to disrupted HPA functioning in urban women and children.
Living in a community with higher crime and violence might alter
mothers' health behaviors, such as smoking, which may subsequently
impact childhood wheeze. Prenatal stress may contribute to poor fetal
growth and low birthweight, another factor linked to child wheeze..
Adjusting for birthweight and maternal smoking in these analyses did not
substantially affect the findings, however.

Air pollution may contribute to early airway remodeling through
associations with asthma development and consequent effects on lung
function. In addition, exposure to pollutants such as PM are associated
with airway remodeling independent of asthma. Pathways involved in the
remodeling process that may be targets of air pollution effects include
xenobiotic metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, epithelial lung repair
and regeneration, and neural plasticity. There is preliminary evidence
that ambient pollutants may influence HPA axis functioning as well.
Disruptions in HPA axis functioning have been linked to a host of
environmental chemicals, e.g., benzene, carbon monoxide, heavy metals.
Particulate matter and ozone influence inflammatory cytokine production
in the pituitary. Transplacental exposure to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) may lead to disturbances of the
pituitary-adrenocortico-placental system in pregnancy and the HPA axis
over the life course.

Strengths of this study include the use of prospective data, the focus
on the prenatal period, the reasonably large lower SES, ethnically
mixed, inner-city cohort, and available data on many important
confounders and potential pathway variables. In addition, we used
advanced methodology (i.e., item response theory) to summarize the
validated multi-item measure of community violence exposure.
Traffic-related air pollution was estimated using validated
spatiotemporal land-use regression models adding satellite-derived AOD
data when estimating PM_{2.5}.

We also acknowledge some limitations. It is possible that mothers
experiencing higher levels of community violence might be less likely to
notice their children's health symptoms if overwhelmed by their own
stress, or conversely tend to over-report children's symptoms if they
are more vigilant overall. It is however reassuring that standard
variables related to repeated wheeze in other studies were associated in
the expected direction in our data (i.e., male gender, maternal atopy).
Nonetheless, while maternal-reported repeated wheeze is a reasonable
surrogate for those who may be more likely to develop asthma later on,
it will be important to examine the relationship between prenatal
maternal community violence exposure and more definitive outcomes as
these children grow up (i.e., physician-diagnosed asthma, lung function)
and see if relationships hold. Future studies would also be enhanced by
assessing biomarkers of potential pathways through which both social and
physical environmental stressors might associate with respiratory health
(e.g., cortisol disruption, autonomic imbalance, immunomodulation,
oxidative stress). In addition, future studies using larger samples may
enhance the power to detect interactions between community violence and
physical environmental factors such as air pollution in the urban
environment. While we examined other environmental factors that may
co-vary with both ECV and ambient pollutants (i.e., cockroach allergen),
we cannot rule out the potential for unmeasured confounding. Also, we
were unable to adjust for postnatal ECV and postnatal BC exposures given
the high correlation with prenatal levels (Spearman's /r/=0.72 for ECV,
and /r/=0.96 for BC; both /p/<0.0001).

In summary, we found independent effects of increased community violence
and higher exposure to traffic-related air pollutants in the prenatal
period on repeated wheeze in these urban children. There was also a
suggestion for an interaction on an additive scale. Because these
factors tend to cluster in the most socially disadvantaged communities,
research that considers psychosocial stress and physical environmental
toxins concurrently, including joint effects, may better inform the
etiology of growing asthma disparities.

Penalized spline curves using GAMs demonstrating the relationship of (A)
prenatal maternal ECV, (B) prenatal BC level (µg/m^{3}), and (C)
prenatal PM_{2.5} level (µg/m^{3}), with log odds of children's repeated
wheeze by age 2 years. Solid lines depict the penalized spline curve
while dotted lines indicate the 95% confidence bounds. Models were
adjusted for child's gender, season of birth, maternal race, education,
atopy, and household cockroach allergens.

*Figure 3.* *Associations between prenatal maternal ECV and children's
repeated wheeze in analyses stratified by air pollutant levels*

This figure demonstrates ORs and 95% CIs for repeated wheeze comparing
medium vs. low ECV groups (squares) and high vs. low ECV groups
(diamonds), stratified by (A) BC median level (0.38 µg/m^{3}) and (B)
PM_{2.5} median level (11.22 µg/m^{3}). The solid markers indicate the
ORs for participants exposed to higher levels (/>/ median) of air
pollution and the hollow markers indicate the ORs for participants
exposed to lower levels (<median) of air pollution. Models were adjusted
for child's gender, season of birth, maternal race, education, and
atopy.
