** Types of studies

*** Cross-sectional Vs Longitudinal

*Cross-sectional studies*(also known as Cross-sectional analysis) form a
class of research methods that involve *observation of all of a
population*, or a representative subset, at a defined time.
 They differ from case-control studies in that they aim to provide data
on the entire population under study, whereas *case-control studies
typically include only individuals with a specific characteristic*, with
a sample, often a tiny minority, of the rest of the population. Both are
a type of observational study. Unlike case-control studies, they can be
used to describe absolute risks and not only relative risks. They may be
used to describe some feature of the population, such as prevalence of
an illness, or they may support inferences of cause and effect.
 *Cross sectional studies are prone to selection Bias.*
 *Longitudinal studies* differ from both in making a series of
observations more than once on members of the study population *over a
period of time*. A longitudinal study is a correlational research study
that involves repeated observations of the same items over long periods
of time --- often many decades.

*** Prospective vs. retrospective studies

*Prospective vs. retrospective studies
*
 Prospective
 A *prospective study watches for outcomes, such as the development of a
disease, during the study period* and relates this to other factors such
as suspected risk or protection factor(s). The study usually involves
taking a cohort of subjects and watching them over a long period. The
outcome of interest should be common; otherwise, the number of outcomes
observed will be too small to be statistically meaningful
(indistinguishable from those that may have arisen by chance). All
efforts should be made to avoid sources of bias such as the loss of
individuals to follow up during the study. Prospective studies usually
have fewer potential sources of bias and confounding than retrospective
studies.
  
 Retrospective
 A *retrospective study looks backwards and examines exposures to
suspected risk or protection factors in relation to an outcome that is
established at the start of the study*. Many valuable case-control
studies, such as Lane and Claypon's 1926 investigation of risk factors
for breast cancer, were retrospective investigations. Most sources of
error due to confounding and bias are more common in retrospective
studies than in prospective studies. For this reason, retrospective
investigations are often criticised. If the outcome of interest is
uncommon, however, the size of prospective investigation required to
estimate relative risk is often too large to be feasible. In
retrospective studies the odds ratio provides an estimate of relative
risk. You should take special care to avoid sources of bias and
confounding in retrospective studies.
 Prospective investigation is required to make precise estimates of
either the incidence of an outcome or the relative risk of an outcome
based on exposure.

*** Case-Control studies

﻿

Case-Control
 *
*Case-control is a type of
retrospective, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological][epidemiological]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design][clinical
study design]]. In a *case-control study, people with a disease (often,
a specific diagnosis, perhaps lung cancer) are matched with people who
do not have the disease (the 'controls').* Further data is then
collected on those individuals and the groups are compared to find out
if other characteristics (perhaps a history of smoking) are also
different between the two groups.
 Case-Control studies are usually but not exclusively retrospective, the
opposite is true for cohort studies. The
 following notes relate case-control to cohort studies:

-  
   •outcome is measured before exposure
-  controls are selected on the basis of not
-  having the outcome
-  good for rare outcomes
-  relatively inexpensive
-  smaller numbers required
-  quicker to complete
-  prone to selection bias
-  prone to recall/retrospective bias

*** Cohort studies

cohort study
 A cohort study or panel study is a form of longitudinal study (a type
of observational study) used in medicine, actuarial science and ecology.
*It is an analysis of risk factors and follows a group of people who do
not have the disease, and uses correlations to determine the absolute
risk of subject contraction*. It is one type of clinical study design
and should be compared with a cross-sectional study.
 *A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or
experience within a defined period*(e.g., are born, are exposed to a
drug or a vaccine, etc.). Thus a group of people who were born on a day
or in a particular period, say 1948, form a birth cohort. The comparison
group may be the general population from which the cohort is drawn, or
it may be another cohort of persons thought to have had little or no
exposure to the substance under investigation, but otherwise similar.
Alternatively, subgroups within the cohort may be compared with each
other.
 *retrospective cohort example:*
 Checking E.K.G's of heart patients from two years ago compared to today

*** Follow-up study

A study in which persons exposed to risk or given a designated
preventive or therapeutic regimen are observed over a period or at
intervals to determine the outcome of the exposure or regimen.

** Risk

*** Relative risk/Risk ratio

Relative risk/Risk ratio
 ﻿In [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics][statistics]] and
mathematical
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology][epidemiology]], relative
risk (RR) or Risk ratio is the risk of an event (or of developing a
disease) relative to exposure. Relative risk is a ratio
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio][ratio]]e
probab[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability][probability]]e event
occurring in the exposed group versus a non-exposed group.
 ﻿Consider an example wh[[EPI500_files/img/Pasted.jpg]]ere the
probab[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability][probability]]veloping
lung cancer among smokers was 20% and among non-smokers 1%. This
situation is expressed in the 2 × 2 table :
 Here, a = 20(%),
b = 80[[EPI500_files/img/Image_fdT.HSnZOUFAagXPm9qvrg_0001.jpg]], c = 1,
and d = 99 Then the relative risk of cancer associated with smoking
would be:
 Smokers would be
twenty[[EPI500_files/img/Image_fdT.HSnZOUFAagXPm9qvrg_0002.jpg]] times
as likely as non-smokers to develop lung cancer.
 Another term for the relative risk is the risk ratio because it is the
ratio of the risk in the exposed divided by the risk in the unexposed.
