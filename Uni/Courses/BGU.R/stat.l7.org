** T-test intro 

The t-statistic was introduced in 1908 by William Sealy Gosset, a chemist working for the Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland

*one sample t-test*

The one-sample t test (מבחן T למדגם בודד) is used to compare an observed mean with a theoretical mean.

the theoretical mean is usually the population mean (the average for the outcome of some population of interest). 

The basic idea of the test is a comparison of the average of the sample (observed average) and the population (expected average)

#+REVEAL: split 
*independent t-test ?*

Independent (or unpaired two sample) (T לבלתי תלויים) t-test is used to compare the means of two unrelated groups of samples.

As an example, we have a cohort of 100 individuals (50 women and 50 men). The question is to test whether the average weight of women is significantly different from that of men?

In this case, we have two independents groups of samples and unpaired t-test can be used to test whether the means are different.

*paired t-test ?*

Paired Student’s t-test (מבחן T למדגמים מזווגים/תלויים) is used to compare the means of two related samples.

That is when you have two values (pair of values) for the same samples.

For example, 20 mice received a treatment X for 3 months. 

The question is to test whether the treatment X has an impact on the weight of the mice at the end of the 3 months treatment. 

The weight of the 20 mice has been measured before and after the treatment. This gives us 20 sets of values before treatment and 20 sets of values after treatment from measuring twice the weight of the same mice.

In this case, paired t-test can be used as the two sets of values being compared are related. We have a pair of values for each mouse (one before and the other after treatment).

#+REVEAL: split 
*T test assumptions : Normality and equal variances*
Many of the statistical procedures including correlation, regression, t test, and analysis of variance assume that the data are *normally distributed*.

Before using t test, you have to check :

*For one-sample t test*: Whether the data are normally distributed


*For independent two samples t test* : Whether the two groups of samples (x and y), being compared, are normally distributed;
and whether the variances of the two samples are equal or not.

*For paired t test* : Whether the difference d ( = x - y) is normally distributed
#+REVEAL: split 
*How to test the normality of data?*

With large enough sample sizes (n > 30) the violation of the normality assumption should not cause major problems. 

This implies that we can ignore the distribution of the data and use parametric tests if we are dealing with large sample sizes.

Normality can be checked by visual inspection >>  Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) we learned previously and histograms

The histogram plot (frequency distribution) provides a visual judgment about whether the distribution is bell shaped.
#+REVEAL: split 
*How to test the equality of variances ?*

The standard two independent samples t test assumes also that the samples have equal variances. 

If the two samples, being compared, follow normal distribution, F test can be performed to compare the variances.

The *null* hypothesis of F test is that the variances of the two populations are equal. 

If the test is significant, null hypothesis are rejected and then we can conclude that the variances are significantly different.
#+REVEAL: split 
The following R code can be used for an F test to compare two variances:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session Rorg  :results none
var.test(x,y)
#+END_SRC
data:  x and y

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
F = 0.8718, num df = 9, denom df = 9, p-value = 0.8414
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.2165 3.5099
sample estimates:
ratio of variances 
            0.8718 
#+END_EXAMPLE 

The p-value of the F-test is = 0.8414. 
It’s greater than the significance level alpha = 0.05. 

In conclusion, there is no significant difference between the variances of the two sets of data. Therefore, we can use the classic t-test witch assume equality of the two variances.

var.test(df$Net.income,df$age)
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL: split 
*What to do when the conditions are not met for t test ?*

The following two-stage procedure is wide accepted:

If normality is accepted, the t test is used;

If the samples being compared are not normally distributed, a non-parametric test like Wilcoxon test is recommended as an alternative to the t test.

If the two samples are normally distributed, but with unequal variances, the Welch t test can be used

** t.test : R function to calculate t test
The R function to use for t test statistics is t.test(). It can be used to calculate the different types of Student t test mentioned above.

A simplified format of the function is:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session Rorg  :results none
# One sample t test :
# Comparison of an observed mean with a
# a theoretical mean
t.test(x, mu=0)

# Independent t test
# Comparison of the means of two independent samples (x & y)
t.test(x, y)

# Paired t test
t.test(x, y, paired=TRUE)
#+END_SRC

The question is whether the average weight of the mice is significantly different from 200g?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Null hypothesis H0: the mean m = 200.

95 percent confidence interval:

#+END_SRC

In the result above:

t is the t-test statistic value (t = 7.0567)

df is the degrees of freedom (df= 9)

p-value is the significance level of the t-test (p-value = 5.942 × 10-5).

The confidence interval (conf.int) of the mean at 95% is also shown (conf.int= [394.1884, 577.4316]) 

and finally, we have the mean value of x (mean = 485.81).
#+REVEAL: split 
The p-value of the test is is much less than the significance level alpha = 0.05. 

We can then *reject null hypothesis* and conclude that:

the mean weight of the mice is significantly different from 200g with a p-value = 5.942 × 10-5.

An outbreak of Salmonella-related illness was attributed to ice cream produced at a certain factory. Scientists measured the level of Salmonella in 9 randomly sampled
batches of ice cream. The levels (in MPN/g) were:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
0.593 0.142 0.329 0.691 0.231 0.793 0.519 0.392 0.418
#+END_EXAMPLE
Is there evidence that the mean level of Salmonella in the ice cream is greater than 0.3 MPN/g (p of 0.1)?
#+REVEAL: split 
#+BEGIN_SRC R :session Rorg  :results none

t.test(x, mu=0.3)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
One Sample t-test
data: x
t = 2.2051, df = 8, p-value = 0.02927
alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 0.3
#+END_EXAMPLE

From the output we see that the p-value = 0.029. Hence, there is moderately strong evidence that the mean Salmonella level in the ice cream is above 0.3 MPN/g.

*** Independent t-test 
As an example, we have a cohort of 20 individuals (10 women and 10 men).

The question is to test whether women’s average weight is significantly different from men’s average weight? 

The number of individuals considered here is obviously low. This is just to illustrate the usage of two-sample t-test.

The confidence interval (conf.int) of the mean differences at 95% is also shown (conf.int= [7.4, 36.52])

the means of the two groups of samples (average weight of women = 73.21, average weight of men =51.25).
#+REVEAL: split 
The p-value of the test is 0.0053, which is less than the significance level alpha = 0.05. 

We can then reject the null hypothesis and conclude that women’s average weight is significantly different from men’s average weight with a p-value = 0.0053.

#+REVEAL: split 
By default, the R t.test() function makes the assumption that the variances of the two groups of samples, being compared, are different.

 Therefore, *Welch t-test* is performed by default. Welch t-test is just an adaptation of t-test, and it is used when the two samples have possibly unequal variances.

The argument “var.equal=TRUE” can be used to indicate to the t.test() function that the two samples have equal variances. However you have to check this assumption before using it.

t is the value of t-test statistics (t = -20.88)

p-value is the significance level of the t-test (p-value = 6.2 × 10-9).

The confidence interval (conf.int) of the mean differences at 95% is also shown (conf.int= [-215.56, -173.42]); 

we have the difference of the means of the two samples (mean diff = -194.49).

#+REVEAL: split 
The p-value of the t-test is 6.2003 × 10-9, which is less than the significance level alpha = 0.05.

A study was performed to test whether cars get better mileage on premium gas than on regular gas. Each of 10 cars was first filled with either regular or premium gas,

the p-value is very low, we reject the null hypothesis. 
There is strong evidence of a mean increase in gas mileage between regular and premium gasoline.

** Dates
*** Basic

Dates are typically entered into R as character strings and then translated into date variables that *are stored numerically*. 

The function *as.Date()* is used to make this translation.

The syntax is *as.Date(X, "input_format")* 

The *default format* for inputting dates is yyyy-mm-dd. 

mydates <- as.Date(c("2007-06-22", "2004-02-13"))

converts the character data to dates using this default format.

*** convert from SAS/excel/other date into R date
#+begin_src r
mod1$day <- as.Date(strptime(mod1$DATE, "%m/%d/%y"))
#+end_src
*** advanced date variable table

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 %a, %A Abbreviated and full weekday name.
 %b, %B Abbreviated and full month name.
 %d Day of the month (01---31).
 %H Hours (00---23).
 %I Hours (01---12).
 %j Day of year (001---366).
 %m Month (01---12).
 %M Minute (00---59).
 %p AM/PM indicator.
 %S Second as decimal number (00---61).
 %U Week (00---53); the first Sunday as day 1 of week 1.
 %w Weekday (0--6, Sunday is 0).
 %W Week (00---53); the first Monday as day 1 of week 1.
 %y Year without century (00---99)
 %Y Year with century.
 %z (output only.) Offset from Greenwich; -0800 is 8 hours west of.
 %Z (output only.) Time zone as a character string (empty if not
available
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** subset by date range
1. make sure the date field is converted to standard R date
2. issue the followiing command

#+BEGIN_SRC R
