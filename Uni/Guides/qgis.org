*Geocoding*
 a GIS layer that translates addresses to coordinates

**** xy longitude and latitude

*X*Longitude (shown as a vertical line) is the angular distance, in
degrees, minutes, and seconds, of a point east or west of the Prime
(Greenwich) Meridian. Lines of longitude are often referred to as
meridians.
 *Y-*Latitude (shown as a horizontal line) is the angular distance, in
degrees, minutes, and seconds of a point north or south of the Equator.
Lines of latitude are often referred to as parallels.

**** projections and coordinate systems
***** 1)projections and coordinate systems

*Projections and Coordinate Systems
**Types of coordinate systems*
 There are two common types of coordinate systems used in GIS:
 *1)GCS:*
 A global or spherical coordinate system such as latitude--longitude.
 These are often referred to as geographic coordinate systems *(GCS)
*is often obtained in Decimal degrees such as x: -70.05 y: 42.15*
*GCS is used for large areas and worldwide*
*
 you will see in GIS when an layer is using GCS that the units are in
decimal degrees

 *
 2)PCS:*
 A Pojected coordinate system *(PC*S) is based on GCS.
 it has bigger numbers sometimes such as :
 it involves a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal
area, or Robinson, all of which (along with numerous other map
projection models) provide various mechanisms to project maps of the
earth's spherical surface onto a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate
plane. Projected coordinate systems are sometimes referred to as map
projections.
 PCS is used for states, countries etc.
 you will see in GIS when an layer is using PCS that the units are in
meters/km etc..

***** 2)order of using: define first and then reproject

when dealing with projections you have to keep this in mind:
 1)*FIRST* you need to define the coordinante if missing (GCS). this is
common when getting x,y cords in db files or rasters etc..
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_xyUw0VyI5kOAsxCgL18WFQ_0001.jpg]]
 2)*then*you can reporoject to any PGS system such as UTM etc.

***** 3)converting between projections

converting between different PCS is an important part in order to get
all the layers to be projected similalrly
 after you decide which projection to use and type (UTM,NAD etc..) you
use the reproject tool:
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_vJ2w1YCvUqi0gimOxa673g_0001.png]]
 then deifne the layer to be projected (to the one you decide to use)
and the output file
 NOTE: in some cases you will need to use a transformation
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_vJ2w1YCvUqi0gimOxa673g_0002.png]]
 the file should now be reprojected

***** fix a offsetted coord system

[[~/Documents/My Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/attach/steve_melly_cord_fix_adjusted.xlsx][Attachment #01
(steve\_melly\_cord\_fix\_adjusted.xlsx)]]
 if you have a layer/shapefile that moved a bit from the true location
you can use the following method to get it approximately back in place
 *In example:*
 bellow the grey raster is the original location and the green raster is
the raster that has been shifted to the left and bottom by a bit
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_Ti3nWWTfjaLk2sgmgWgkBA_0006.png]] to
[[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_Ti3nWWTfjaLk2sgmgWgkBA_0007.png]]
 *to solve this:*
 use a correct layer/file to base your correction on. open the layer
properties and extract the info such as cell size and
e[[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_Ti3nWWTfjaLk2sgmgWgkBA_0008.png]]xtent:
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_Ti3nWWTfjaLk2sgmgWgkBA_0009.png]]
 and
 then take a sample point/grid in the shifted layer:
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/ARCGIS_files/img/Image_Ti3nWWTfjaLk2sgmgWgkBA_0010.png]]
 and mark down the X,Y of that point
 then using a math application (like excel) start calculating the
differences *(see attachment)*
 for *X1*use the Left extent of the original layer plus the cell size
divided by 2:
 -108.90066788+0.012048575/2
 for *Y1* use the Bottom extent of the original layer plus the cell size
divided by 2:
 29.9993652723+0.012048575/2
 for *X2* and *Y2* take the X,Y of the sample point
 We then calcualte the diff between X2 and X1 and devide it by the cell
size of the original layer (0.012048575)
 the rest are other calculation that can be seen in the attached file

%Tip (the above link also has an online calulator from DD to ITM)%

The standard coordinate grid in Israel is called `Israel Transverse Mercator` (ITM), and is sometimes informally referred to as the "new Israel grid" (רשת ישראל חדשה). This grid appears in detailed maps of Israel. Nonetheless, the older and less accurate Israel Cassini Soldner (ICS) grid or "old Israel grid" (רשת ישראל ישנה) is also still used in many places. For example, despite the official adoption of ITM in 1994, the ICS grid is still displayed more prominently in Israeli hiking maps (מפות סימון שבילים) and is consequently more commonly used by hikers.

The ITM grid is a transverse Mercator projection, meaning that the surface of the earth is projected onto a cylinder whose axis of symmetry is parallel to the equator. This provides an accurate projection along a longitudinal slice of the earth, with the inaccuracy increasing as one moves away from this axis. Thus, for example, the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid divides the earth into 60 longitudinal slices, each projected separately. Since Israel is a narrow country, whose span from east to west barely exceeds 100 kilometers, a single projection is sufficient for accurately representing the entire area.
