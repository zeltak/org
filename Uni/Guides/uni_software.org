*** using envi to transfer modis data to gis 2

**** layer stacking

first of all it is better to use the MODIS web interface to order data
(see [[javascript:;][here]]) and use the build in post processing
function to get the data georefrenced. the output should be either
geo-tiff or hdf. i choose geotiff.
 then open Envi and load a bunch of images at once (load for example an
entire month)
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/image.png]]
 then go to basic tools image stacking to add the images onto one file
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/image%202.png]]
 choose import file
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/image%203.png]]
 and add all the files (with shift) and press ok
 make sure you import *to mem*ory and press ok
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/image%204.png]]
 then go to the main open layers window and export the stacked layer to
file
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/image%205.png]]
 this should result in two files and .img file and .hdr (header) file

**** process the ignore values

After the stack is created edit the header
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/Image_4Y0sPp3CmNIWFMqdBtg68g_0001.png]]
 then choose the data ignore value
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/Image_4Y0sPp3CmNIWFMqdBtg68g_0002.png]]
 enter what data values you want to be ignores (-9999) in my case
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/Image_4Y0sPp3CmNIWFMqdBtg68g_0003.png]]

**** scaling

after the first few steps you need to scale the data according to the
products (MODIS in our case) discription
 this is done with band math.
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/Image_JEX-2xP.7Vqi49GNEQX-Og_0001.png]]
 then enter the correct forumla and scale facor. In the modis data the
scale is 0.001 so we enter the following formula:
  float(b1*0.001)
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/Image_JEX-2xP.7Vqi49GNEQX-Og_0002.png]]
 then the b1 needs to be mapped to the actuall data (memory1 in this
example) and the band math can be run
 [[~/Dropbox/Org/Uni/Guides/uni_software_files/img/Image_JEX-2xP.7Vqi49GNEQX-Og_0003.png]]
 make sure you save to memory and press ok, then save file as before
 
** Cluster
*** login

To login to the Harvard cluster
 in the terminal :

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ssh -X ekloog@hpcc.sph.harvard.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ekloog-user name
 hpcc.sph.harvard.edu-harvard adress
 you will be prompted for a password: enter hu + first 6 numbers of yourHarvard ID

*** operation

When you are submitting a job to the cluster use the bsub command and
then your usual UNIX batch commands.

 [gmazzu@hpcc /]$bsub R CMD BATCH --no-save job1.R job1.out

 In this case user gmazzu is submitting an R job called job1.R
 What jobs of mine are running?
 Once you have submitted jobs you can see what is running by using the
bjobs command.

 [gmazzu@hpcc /]$ bjobs

 JOBID USER STAT QUEUE FROM\_HOST EXEC\_HOST JOB\_NAME SUBMIT\_TIME
 1014 gmazzu RUN preemptabl hpcc compute-0-2 *.2 1 1000 Aug 31 10:22
 1011 gmazzu RUN preemptabl hpcc compute-0-1 *.2 1 1000 Aug 31 10:22
 1015 gmazzu RUN preemptabl hpcc compute-0-0 *.2 1 1000 Aug 31 10:22
 1018 gmazzu RUN preemptabl hpcc compute-0-2 *.2 1 1000 Aug 31 10:22
 Stopping jobs
 If you would like to stop a job, use the bkill command. You would use
bkill and then the JOBID which you can see in the example above.

 [gmazzu@hpcc /]$ bkill 1018


*** Queing

send your job to the IT queue:

 bsub -q it "Your R job"

 example:

 bsub -q it " R CMD BATCH --save /usr1/home/ekloog/code/GAM\_v3.r
job.out"


*** submit R script

1) copy all files and script through ssh/scp to your home directory on
the cluster
 2)once you have that setup adjust your r script accordingly (change
location to the new home directory in the cluster). for example:
 GAM\_T2005 = read.csv("/usr1/home/ekloog/files/final\_T2005.csv",
header=T)
 3)after you have your script ready proceed to run the R job. this is
done with the bath command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 bsub R CMD BATCH --save /usr1/home/ekloog/code/GAM\_v3.r job.out

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 bsub -cluster job que (needed for every command preformed on the
cluster)
 R- The command you run (could be SAS etc...but R in this example)
 CMD BATCH --save - The R option which are CMD BATH for batching the
script and --save to save the workspace
 job.out- The Job log output that show the R console output

*** To run SAS in batch mode

To run SAS in batch mode:
 
 [gmazzu@hpcc /]$ bsub sas -noterminal code.sas -log file.log

**** RSTUDIO Server

*rstudio server*
 We have the RStudio Server installed on the cluster which provides an
 integrated GUI through a web browser ( Firefox recommended ). To access
the
 Rstudio Server point your web-browser to

[[http://rstudio.rc.fas.harvard.edu/][http://rstudio.rc.fas.harvard.edu/]]
 and log on with your RC username and password. (You need to be on the
VPN for
 this to work. )

**** submitting lsf batch jobs

*submitting lsf batch jobs
*
 You can submit your R jobs to one of the available queues ( type "

bqueues -u ekloog

" to display the queues available to you ).
 (1) Prepare a job submission script
 You can use a batch job submission script as the one below
 #!/bin/sh
 #BSUB -J rtest
 #BSUB -q short\_serial
 #BSUB -n 1
 #BSUB -o rtest.out
 #BSUB -e rtest.err
 module load math/R-2.15.0
 R CMD BATCH --vanilla --no-save test.R test.out
 NOTE: You can look at

[[http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/high-performance-computing/lsf-submit-an-lsf-job-2/][http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/high-performance-computing/lsf-submit-an-lsf-job-2/]]
 for the meaning of the #BSUB directives
 (2) Submit the job to the queue
 If you name the above batch-job submission script "test.run" it is
submitted to
 the queue by typing in

[pkrastev@heroint5 R]$ bsub < test.run
 Job <27797710> is submitted to queue <short\_serial>.

 Alternatively, instead of using a batch-job submission script, you can
do
 everything on the command line

[pkrastev@heroint5 R]$ bsub -J rtest -q short\_serial -n 1 -o rtest.out
-e
 rtest.err R CMD BATCH --vanilla --no-save test.R test.out

*** Submit an LSF Job

The[[http://www.platform.com/Products/platform-lsf][LSF]] queueing
software manages the hundreds of computers in the Odyssey cluster. To
run software on the cluster, you login to odyssey.fas.harvard.edu (the
"head node", which is really a nickname for three identical computers,
iliadaccess01, 02, and 03). Then you use the bsub command to "submit" a
job to an
appropriate[[http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/high-performance-computing/general-use-odyssey-queues/][queue]],
where it waits for a computer to become free. At that point, LSF sends
your job to that other computer, where it runs. When it finishes, LSF
will email you.
 Note that the iliadaccess machines are only for submitting jobs. If you
try to run a program there without bsub, it will be stopped after a
couple minutes.
 Here is
an[[http://www.sysbio.harvard.edu/csb/resources/computational/lsf.html][LSF
cheat sheet]] describing the basic LSF commands.
 To run a job, first create a submission script. Make a file somewhere
on Odyssey (in your home directory or a sub-directory of that) called
hello.bsub that looks like this:

#!/bin/sh
 #BSUB -u
[[http://rc.fas.harvard.edumailto:someguy@fas.harvard.edu][someguy@fas.harvard.edu]]
 #BSUB -J my\_blast
 #BSUB -o blast.out
 #BSUB -e blast.err
 #BSUB -W 2:00
 #BSUB -q normal\_serial
 blastall -p blastp -e 1e-5 -d nr myseqs.fasta

(Of course you'll want to change the email address, program name,
filenames, etc.) The lines beginning with#BSUB are instructions to LSF.

-  -u email says where to send the LSF reports
-  -J name names the job, which is useful if you're running multiple
   jobs and run a bjobs command
-  -q queue names
   the[[http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/high-performance-computing/general-use-odyssey-queues/][queue]]
   you're submitting the job to
-  -e filename and-o filename instruct LSF where to print output from
   the job. Without these definitions, the output will get emailed to
   you, or disappear if the output is many megabytes. (-o is stdout, the
   usual output of a program, while -e, stderr, is where errors usually
   go)
-  -W hh:mm defines how long the job will run for. When the job reaches
   this limit it will automatically be killed if it has not finished
   running. This is useful for telling the scheduler how long you think
   you job will run for so that it can fit you in to the queue easier.

After the instructions to LSF, you just type one or more commands that
you would run on the command line. The above scripts runs a biology
program called BLAST. Commands often have options, input filenames, etc.
If you want to run a program you installed in your own directory, make
sure to write./programname
 To submit the job, at the command line, type bsub, a less-than sign,
and the name of the submission script

[hptc@iliadaccess01 ~]$ bsub < hello.bsub.
 Job <797679> is submitted to queue <short\_serial>.

As shown above, LSF will return a job id, which you'll see when you use
the bjobs command. Also,if you want to stop the job, use "bkill jobid".

*** FAS VPN

FAS VPN

Remote access to your data and some services in the Sciences requires a
VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection to access from outside Sciences
networks and off campus.
 If you wish to connect to your lab or personal lab data stores but are
connected via wireless or have an address outside of those associated
with the Sciences, you will need a VPN Connection to access them.
 Data storage available via VPN:
 RCFS1, RCFS2, RCFS3, (direct lab storage systems)
 The VPN is accessible via a web browser
at[[https://vpn.fas.harvard.edu/][https://vpn.fas.harvard.edu]].
 you can login with your HUID for the USERNAME (don't put the @FAS realm
part) and PIN for the PASSWORD
 OR:
 The USERNAME field in the form requires two parts:username andrealm
name. Yourusername should be your FAS username, and in this case
therealm name is FAS.
 USERNAME:username@FAS
 PASSWORD: (supply your usual FAS password)
 these two ways of logging in are equivalent

*** start screen

Start a New Screen Session

To start a new screen named mywork, use the following shell command:
 screen -S mywork

 *Detaching from a Screen Session
*
 Note: DO NOT CLOSE THE CONNECTION WITHOUT DETACHING WITH ctrl-D

In order to disconnect your client and be able to attach to the screen
session later, you must leave the screen session running.
 You do this by detaching from it.
 Use the following screen command:
 ctrl-a d

You can do this either when while it's idle at a shell prompt or while
some program is running in the foreground.
 You will be returned to your original shell session, and anything
running in your screen session will continue to run in the background.
 You can now exit the shell session and shutdown your computer.
 Do not run exit or logout while inside the screen session, if you plan
on reattaching to it later.
 These commands will terminate the screen session.

 *Attach to an Existing Screen Session
*

You can list your running screen sessions with the following shell
command:

screen -ls

For example, following the above example, you should see something like:
 [hptc@iliadaccess01 workshop]$ screen -ls
 There is a screen on:
 12954.mywork (Detached)
 1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-hptc.

You can reattach to it with the following shell command:
 screen -x myworkY
 our ssh client display will fill with what's currently running the in
the screen.

** excel

*** cell functions (merge etc)

**** intro

 Merge cells from all or some worksheets into one Master sheet
 The examples will add a worksheet with the name RDBMergeSheet to your
workbook and will copy cells
 from every worksheet in the ActiveWorkbook to this worksheet. Each time
you run one of the examples it
 will first delete the summary worksheet named RDBMergeSheet if it
exists and then adds a new one to
 the workbook. This ensures that the data is always up to date after you
run the code.
 In the examples I use a values/formats copy but below the first example
there is example code to copy
 only the values or everything to the RDBMergeSheet.
 Important:
 The macro examples use the LastRow or LastCol function that you can
find in the last section of this page.
 Copy the macro(s) and function(s) in a standard module of your
workbook.
 If you have no idea where to paste the code then check out this page.

[[http://www.rondebruin.nl/code.htm][http://www.rondebruin.nl/code.htm]]
 Example workbook
 Download a zip file with a workbook with the code from this page to
test the examples.
 Download MergeWorksheetsCode.zip
 Copy a range of each sheet
 Note: This example use the function LastRow
 This example copy the range A1:G1 from each worksheet.
 Change the range here
 'Fill in the range that you want to copy
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A1:G1")
 Sub CopyRangeFromMultiWorksheets()
 Dim sh As Worksheet
 Dim DestSh As Worksheet
 Dim Last As Long
 Dim CopyRng As Range
 With Application
 .ScreenUpdating = False
 .EnableEvents = False
 End With
 'Delete the sheet "RDBMergeSheet" if it exist
 Application.DisplayAlerts = False
 On Error Resume Next
 ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("RDBMergeSheet").Delete
 On Error GoTo 0
 Application.DisplayAlerts = True
 'Add a worksheet with the name "RDBMergeSheet"
 Set DestSh = ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets.Add
 DestSh.Name = "RDBMergeSheet"
 'loop through all worksheets and copy the data to the DestSh
 For Each sh In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 'Find the last row with data on the DestSh
 Last = LastRow(DestSh)
 'Fill in the range that you want to copy
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A1:G1")
 'Test if there enough rows in the DestSh to copy all the
data
 If Last + CopyRng.Rows.Count > DestSh.Rows.Count Then
 MsgBox "There are not enough rows in the Destsh"
 GoTo ExitTheSub
 End If
 'This example copies values/formats, if you only want to
copy the
 'values or want to copy everything look at the example
below this macro
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats
 Application.CutCopyMode = False
 End With
 'Optional: This will copy the sheet name in the H column
 DestSh.Cells(Last + 1,
"H").Resize(CopyRng.Rows.Count).Value = sh.Name
 End If
 Next
 ExitTheSub:
 Application.Goto DestSh.Cells(1)
 'AutoFit the column width in the DestSh sheet
 DestSh.Columns.AutoFit
 With Application
 .ScreenUpdating = True
 .EnableEvents = True
 End With
 End Sub
 Tips to change the examples
 In the example above I copy the range A1:G1 but you can also use
 Set CopyRng = sh.UsedRange
 To copy all cells with data on the sheet
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A1").CurrentRegion
 To copy the current region of cell A1
 The current region is a range bounded by any combination of blank rows
and blank column
 Set CopyRng = sh.Rows("1")
 To copy a whole row or rows( use "1:8" then)
 Copy only values or everything
 Replace this :
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats
 Application.CutCopyMode = False
 End With
 With:
 With CopyRng
 DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A").Resize(.Rows.Count, \_
 .Columns.Count).Value = .Value
 End With
 If you only want to copy the values.
 Or Replace this :
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats
 Application.CutCopyMode = False
 End With
 With:
 CopyRng.Copy DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 If you want to copy everything.
 Do not loop through all sheets in the workbook
 
 Tip 1:
 Replace this line:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 With:
 If LCase(Left(sh.Name, 4)) = "week" Then
 If you want to copy only from sheets with a name that start with week.
 Tip 2:
 Replace this line:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 with:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name And sh.Visible = True Then
 If you want to copy only from the visible sheets in your workbook.
 Tip 3:
 Replace this line:
 For Each sh In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
 With:
 For Each sh In ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(Array("Sheet1", "Sheet3"))
 And remove this two lines:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then and End If before Next
 If you want to copy only from sheets that are in the Array.
 Tip 4:
 Replace this line:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 With:
 If IsError(Application.Match(sh.Name, \_
 Array(DestSh.Name, "Total Sheet", "Menu Sheet"), 0)) Then
 If you want to exclude more sheets then the DestSh.
 Copy from row 2 till the last row with data
 Note: This example use the function LastRow
 Note: You can use the tips above also in this example
 In example 1 you can see that you can copy all cells on a worksheet
with this line:
 Set CopyRng = sh.UsedRange
 But what if we do not want to copy the same header row each time.
 The example below will copy from row 2 till the last row with data on
each sheet
 Change the start row in the macro if you want to start in a different
row.
 'Fill in the start row
 StartRow = 2
 If you want to copy the header row in the first row of the
RDBMergeSheet
 then copy the code below if each worksheet have the same headers after
 this line : If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 'Copy header row, change the range if you use more columns
 If WorksheetFunction.CountA(DestSh.UsedRange) = 0 Then
 sh.Range("A1:Z1").Copy DestSh.Range("A1")
 End If
 Sub CopyDataWithoutHeaders()
 Dim sh As Worksheet
 Dim DestSh As Worksheet
 Dim Last As Long
 Dim shLast As Long
 Dim CopyRng As Range
 Dim StartRow As Long
 With Application
 .ScreenUpdating = False
 .EnableEvents = False

 Last = LastRow(DestSh)
 shLast = LastRow(sh)
 'If sh is not empty and if the last row >= StartRow copy
the CopyRng
 If shLast > 0 And shLast >= StartRow Then

 Set CopyRng = sh.Range(sh.Rows(StartRow),
sh.Rows(shLast))
 'Test if there enough rows in the DestSh to copy all
the data
 If Last + CopyRng.Rows.Count > DestSh.Rows.Count Then
 MsgBox "There are not enough rows in the Destsh"
 GoTo ExitTheSub
 End If
 'This example copies values/formats, if you only want
to copy the
 'values or want to copy everything look below example 1
on this page
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")

 .PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats
 Application.CutCopyMode = False
 End With
 End If
 End If
 Next

 Application.Goto DestSh.Cells(1)

 DestSh.Columns.AutoFit
 With Application

 .EnableEvents = True
 End With
 End Sub
 Copy a range/column after the last column with data
 Note: This example use the function LastCol
 This example copy column A from each sheet after the last column with
data on the DestSh.
 I use A:A to copy the whole column but you can also use a range like
A1:A10
 Use A:C if you want to copy more columns.
 Change it here
 'Fill in the column(s) that you want to copy
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A:A")
 Remember that Excel 97-2003 have only 256 columns.
 Excel 2007 has 16384 columns.

*** import batch txt files

 Copy every TXT or CSV file that you select in a new worksheet of a
newly created workbook
 Ron de Bruin (last update 30-Aug-2007)
 Go back to the Excel tips page
 Example for TXT files
 The macro below will copy every txt file that you select with
GetOpenFilename to your workbook.
 If you select ten txt files in the folder then you end up with 10 new
worksheets in
 your workbook. Each worksheet will have the name of the txt file.
 Note: you can hold the CTRL key if you want to select more files or use
the Shift key to select
 a block of files in GetOpenFilename. Tip: With Ctrl a you select all
files in the folder.
 I did not use all the properties for QueryTables in my macro because a
lot of them are already
 what I want by default. If you don't get the results you want then
record a macro when you
 perform the action manually.
 Then look at the recorded code and add the code lines to the macro
Get\_TXT\_Files.
 Copy all code in a normal module of your workbook
 Alt F11
 Insert Module
 Paste the code
 Alt q to go back to Excel
 Alt F8 to open the macro dialog
 Select the macro and press Run
 This example is for Delimited txt files, see the example below this
macro for FixedWidth
 Read the information in the macro Get\_TXT\_Files before you try the
macro.
 Maybe you want to use a different delimiter or change the format of a
column.

*** get macros available in all your workbooks

 How do I create a PERSONAL.XLS(B) or Add-in
 Ron de Bruin (last update 8-april-2008)
 Go back to the Excel tips page
 PERSONAL.XLS(B)
 If you want that certain code is available in all your workbooks, then
use your
 PERSONAL.XLS or in Excel 2007 your PERSONAL.XLSB file.
 What is it:
 This is a hidden workbook that opens when you start Excel.
 The code you copy in this workbook is available in all workbooks you
have opened in Excel.
 Where is it:
 If it exists, you can find the file in the Excel startup folder.
 C:\Documents and Settings\Ron\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART
 In Vista look here
 C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART
 Note: Ron is the username in the path above
 With code you find the correct path on your machine with this line
 1) Open excel
 2) Hit alt-F11 to get to the VBE
 3) Hit ctrl-g to see the immediate window and type this:
 4) ?Application.StartupPath
 You'll see the startup path returned
 How do you create the file if it does not exist:
 If it does not exist then record a dummy macro and change the "Store
macro in:"
 drop down to Personal Macro Workbook. Excel creates the file for you
then in the correct folder.
 Excel 97-2003: Tools>Macro...Record New Macro.
 Excel 2007: On the "Developer" tab click on Record macro.
 To display the "Developer" tab go to Office Button >Excel
Options...Popular.
 Or faster click the button on the bottom left corner of the Excel 2007
window to start the recording.
 Press OK in the dialog that you see now
 Because we only want Excel to create the file for us we can stop the
recording directly.
 Press the Stop Recording button or use Tools>Macros...Stop recording in
Excel 97-2003
 In Excel 2007 you can press the Stop Recording Button on the Developers
tab or click the
 button on the bottom left corner of the Excel window to stop the
recording
 Now we use Alt F11 to go to the VBE editor(working in all Excel
versions)
 Or:
 Excel 97-2003: Tools>Macro>Visual Basic Editor.
 Excel 2007: Click on the button named "Visual Basic" on the "Developer"
tab
 Make the file ready
 Note: I use the name PERSONAL.XLS in the text below but in Excel 2007
the name is PERSONAL.XLSB
 To be sure that we see the Project Window, Code window and the
Properties window we use one time.
 Ctrl-r (to see the project explorer)
 F7 (to view the code window)
 F4 (to view the properties window)
 Now we give the PERSONAL.XLS a unique project name (Default is
VBAProject)
 Select the PERSONAL.XLS in the project window and change the name in
the properties window.
 
 Now use Ctrl-s or File>Save in the VBA editor to save the PERSONAL.XLS.
 We are now ready to add code (macros or/and functions) to this file so
we can use it in all the workbooks.
 With Insert>Module in the VBA editor you can also add more modules to
the PERSONAL.XLS.
 This way you can organize your code in this file.
 Use only code here that you use yourself and not code that you use in
files that you distribute to other users.
 In this case add the code in the modules of the workbook itself. Or see
the ”Add-in” part on this page.
 Example 1: Macro
 Public Sub Test()
 MsgBox "Insert your favorite code here"
 End Sub
 1) Select the PERSONAL.XLS in the project window and click on the +
before it
 2) Then click on the + before Modules
 3) Double click on Module1 to open the code window on the right
 4) We copy/paste the example macro in this module.
 5) Now use Ctrl-s or File>Save in the VBA editor to save the
PERSONAL.XLS.
 6) We use Alt--q to go back to Excel or use "File >Close and Return to
Microsoft Excel".
 7) You can run the macro then with Alt-F8 or Tools>Macro...Macros /
Developer tab>Macros
 Note: You can delete the dummy macro that we used to create the
PERSONAL.XLS.
 Example 2: Function
 This function gives you the ISO week number that is used in Europe and
a lot of other countries.
 Note: This function is not available in Excel.
 Public Function IsoWeekNum(d1 As Date) As Integer
 ' Daniel Maher
 Dim d2 As Long
 d2 = DateSerial(Year(d1 - Weekday(d1 - 1) + 4), 1, 3)
 IsoWeekNum = Int((d1 - d2 + Weekday(d2) + 5) / 7)
 End Function
 1) Select the PERSONAL.XLS in the project window and click on the +
before it
 2) Then click on the + before Modules
 3) Double click on Module1 to open the code window on the right
 4) We copy/paste the example function in this module.
 5) Now use Ctrl-s or File>Save in the VBA editor to save the
PERSONAL.XLS.
 6) We use Alt--q to go back to Excel or use "File >Close and Return to
Microsoft Excel".
 Now we can use this in a worksheet cell with the date in A1
 =PERSONAL.XLS!IsoWeekNum(A1)
 If you create a reference in the workbook where you want to use it to
your
 PERSONAL.XLS then you can use
 =IsoWeekNum(A1)
 Go to Tools>References in the VBA editor with the workbook selected in
the project window and
 add a check mark before RonPersonal. (Save the workbook then)
 Problems with the PERSONAL.XLS(B) workbook
 What to do if your PERSONAL.XLS(B) is visible
 When you open Excel and you see PERSONAL.XLS(B) in the title bar you
can use this to hide it.
 Excel 97-2003: Window>Hide
 Excel 2007 : On the View tab in the window group choose Hide
 Then close Excel and say Yes to save the changes to your PERSONAL file.
 PERSONAL.XLS(B) will not open but is in the correct location
 When Excel think the file is corrupt it can disable the file.
 You can re-enable it here but if it is really corrupted replace it with
a backup.
 Excel 2002-2003: Help>About MS Excel>Disabled items
 Excel 2007 : Office button>Excel Options..Add-ins
 In the "Manage:" dropdown (bottom of the
dialog)
 Choose "Disabled Items
 Go
 Use a Add-in
 You can also create an add-in to store code that you want to use in all
workbooks.
 (A add-in is also a hidden workbook like PERSONAL.XLS)
 This is a good way if you want to distribute code to other users. Open
a new workbook and copy
 the code in this workbook and then use File>Save As or Office
Button>Save As to save it as
 Excel Add-in, use a name like MyUtility.xla for example(xlam in Excel
2007).
 Before you save it give MyUtility.xla a unique project name (Default is
VBAProject)
 see how I do it above with the PERSONAL.XLS(B).
 You can install the add-in like this:
 1) Tools>Add-ins in Excel 97-2003
 Office Button>Excel Options..Add-ins and then Manage Excel
add-ins...Go in Excel 2007
 Or use the shortcut (Alt ti example for the English version)
 2) Browse to the XLA(M) file
 3) OK
 4) Add a check mark before it in the list
 5) OK
 Now every time you open Excel it opens the add-in and you can use the
code in all workbooks.
 Note: Add-in macros not show up in Alt-F8 or in Tools>Macro...Macros in
97-2003 or in
 Developer tab>Macros in 2007. You must make a menu for the macros in
the add-in.
 Create your own menu/toolbar to run the code

*** combine multiple columns to one

to do that:
 make sure your columns are formatted as general
 in a new column (again general) go to the first cell and choose the
formula concentrate (under the text catagory)
 choose the colums to join

*** how to apply a formula to the entire column in excel other than
draging it down

As long as there are no blank rows, go to the first cell, then hover
your mouse to the lower right hand corner of that cell until the cursor
becomes a black plus, then double click. It will copy the formula down
until it finds a break (blank cell) in what you're trying to copy.

*** Julian Dates

*Julian Dates*
 
 Many applications (especially mainframe systems) store dates in the
Julian format, which is a 5 digit number, consisting of a 2 digit year
and a 3 digit day-of-year number. For example, 24-August-1999 is stored
as 99236, since 24-August is the 236th day of the year. Excel doesn't
support Julian dates directly, but you can use them with only a few
fairly simple formulas.
 The first section of this page describes the Excel worksheet formulas
for working with Julian dates. The second section describes the VBA
procedures.
 Converting A Standard Date To A Julian Date
 The formula below will convert a standard Excel date in A1 to a Julian
Date.
 =RIGHT(YEAR(A1),2)&TEXT(A1-DATE(YEAR(A1),1,0),"000")
 This formula takes the 2 right-most characters of the YEAR of the date
in A1, and then appends the number of days between the date in A1 and
the 0th day of that year. The TEXT function formats the day-of-year
number as three digits, with leading zeros if necessary.
 Converting A Julian Date To A Standard Date
 The formula below will convert a Julian date to a standard Excel date.
 =DATE(IF(0+(LEFT(A1,2))<30,2000,1900)+LEFT(A1,2),1,RIGHT(A1,3))
 If the year digits of the Julian date are less than 30 (i.e., 00 to
29), the date is assumed to be a 2000 century year. If the year digits
of the Julian date are greater than or equal to 30 (i.e., 30 to 99), the
date is assumed to be a 1900 century year. This formula works by taking
advantage of the fact that the DATE function can handle days beyond the
"normal" days in a month. For example, DATE correctly computes
100-Jan-1999 to be 10-April-1999.
 These Julian dates must have the leading zero or zeros for years
between 2000 and 2009. For example the 123rd day of 2000 must be entered
as 00123. Format the cell as TEXT before entering the data, or enter an
apostrophe before the Julian date -- e.g., '00123. This will prevent
Excel from treating the Julian date as a number and suppressing the
leading zeros.
 Differences Between Two Julian Dates
 Now that we know how to convert a Julian date to a standard date, it is
simple to compute the number of days between two Julian dates. For
example, suppose we have two Julian dates, in A1 and A2. The formula
below will subtract the two dates.
 =DATE(IF(0+(LEFT(A1,2))<30,2000,1900)+LEFT(A1,2),1,RIGHT(A1,3)) -
 DATE(IF(0+(LEFT(A2,2))<30,2000,1900)+LEFT(A2,2),1,RIGHT(A2,3))
 Be sure to format the cell containing this formula as General.
 Add A Number Of Days To A Julian Date
 You can add some number of days to a Julian date. Suppose we have a
Julian date in A1, and a number of days in A2. The formula below will
add the number of days in A2 to the Julian date in A1, and return the
date as a standard Excel date.
 =DATE(IF(0+(LEFT(A1,2))<30,2000,1900)+LEFT(A1,2),1,RIGHT(A1,3)+A2)
 This formula works just like the formula we used to convert a Julian
date to a standard date, but adds A2 to the days. This works because the
DATE function will correctly compute a date like 400-Jan-1999 to be
4-Feb-2000. For example, if A1 contains 99001 (1-Jan-1999), and A2
contains 400, the formula will return 5-Feb-2000.
 If you want your result to be a Julian date, then use the following
formula, which is just our first formula to convert standard dates to
Julian dates, with the formula above inserted into it wherever we need
the date.
 =RIGHT(YEAR(DATE(IF(0+(LEFT(A1,2))<30,2000,1900)+
 LEFT(A1,2),1,RIGHT(A1,3)+A2)),2)&
TEXT(DATE(IF(0+(LEFT(A1,2))<30,2000,1900)+LEFT(A1,2),1,RIGHT(A1,3)+A2)-
 DATE(YEAR(DATE(IF(0+(LEFT(A1,2))<30,2000,1900)+
 LEFT(A1,2),1,RIGHT(A1,3)+A2)),1,0),"000")
 For example, if A1 contains 99001 (1-Jan-1999), and A2 contains 400,
the formula will return 00036, the 36th day of the year 2000.
 
 VBA Procedures For Working With Julian Dates
 The functions below will convert a Julian date to a standard Excel
date, and convert a standard Excel date to a Julian date.
 The JDateToDate function will accept a five-character Julian date and
return the standard Excel date.
 Function JDateToDate(JDate As String) As Long
 Dim TheYear As Integer
 Dim TheDay As Integer
 Dim TheDate As Long
 TheYear = CInt(Left(JDate, 2))
 If TheYear < 30 Then
 TheYear = TheYear + 2000
 Else
 TheYear = TheYear + 1900
 End If
 TheDay = CInt(Right(JDate, 3))
 TheDate = DateSerial(TheYear, 1, TheDay)
 JDateToDate = TheDate
 End Function
 The DateToJDate function will accept a standard Excel date and return a
five-character string representing the Julian date.
 Function DateToJDate(TheDate As Long) As String
 Dim TheYear As Integer
 Dim TheDays As Integer
 Dim JDate As String
 TheYear = Year(TheDate)
 TheDays = DateDiff("d", DateSerial(TheYear, 1, 0), TheDate)
 JDate = Right(Format(TheYear, "0000"), 2) & Format(TheDays, "000")
 DateToJDate = JDate
 End Function

**** intro

 Merge cells from all or some worksheets into one Master sheet
 Ron de Bruin (last update 22-Nov-2008)
 Go back to the Excel tips page
 The examples will add a worksheet with the name RDBMergeSheet to your
workbook and will copy cells
 from every worksheet in the ActiveWorkbook to this worksheet. Each time
you run one of the examples it
 will first delete the summary worksheet named RDBMergeSheet if it
exists and then adds a new one to
 the workbook. This ensures that the data is always up to date after you
run the code.
 In the examples I use a values/formats copy but below the first example
there is example code to copy
 only the values or everything to the RDBMergeSheet.
 Important:
 The macro examples use the LastRow or LastCol function that you can
find in the last section of this page.
 Copy the macro(s) and function(s) in a standard module of your
workbook.
 If you have no idea where to paste the code then check out this page.
 http://www.rondebruin.nl/code.htm
 Example workbook
 Download a zip file with a workbook with the code from this page to
test the examples.
 Download MergeWorksheetsCode.zip
 Copy a range of each sheet
 Note: This example use the function LastRow
 This example copy the range A1:G1 from each worksheet.
 Change the range here
 'Fill in the range that you want to copy
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A1:G1")
 Sub CopyRangeFromMultiWorksheets()
 Dim sh As Worksheet
 Dim DestSh As Worksheet
 Dim Last As Long
 Dim CopyRng As Range
 With Application
 .ScreenUpdating = False
 .EnableEvents = False
 End With
 'Delete the sheet "RDBMergeSheet" if it exist
 Application.DisplayAlerts = False
 On Error Resume Next
 ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("RDBMergeSheet").Delete
 On Error GoTo 0
 Application.DisplayAlerts = True
 'Add a worksheet with the name "RDBMergeSheet"
 Set DestSh = ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets.Add
 DestSh.Name = "RDBMergeSheet"
 'loop through all worksheets and copy the data to the DestSh
 For Each sh In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 'Find the last row with data on the DestSh
 Last = LastRow(DestSh)
 'Fill in the range that you want to copy
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A1:G1")
 'Test if there enough rows in the DestSh to copy all the
data
 If Last + CopyRng.Rows.Count > DestSh.Rows.Count Then
 MsgBox "There are not enough rows in the Destsh"
 GoTo ExitTheSub
 End If
 'This example copies values/formats, if you only want to
copy the
 'values or want to copy everything look at the example
below this macro
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats
 Application.CutCopyMode = False
 End With
 'Optional: This will copy the sheet name in the H column
 DestSh.Cells(Last + 1,
"H").Resize(CopyRng.Rows.Count).Value = sh.Name
 End If
 Next
 ExitTheSub:
 Application.Goto DestSh.Cells(1)
 'AutoFit the column width in the DestSh sheet
 DestSh.Columns.AutoFit
 With Application
 .ScreenUpdating = True
 .EnableEvents = True
 End With
 End Sub
 Tips to change the examples
 In the example above I copy the range A1:G1 but you can also use
 Set CopyRng = sh.UsedRange
 To copy all cells with data on the sheet
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A1").CurrentRegion
 To copy the current region of cell A1
 The current region is a range bounded by any combination of blank rows
and blank column
 Set CopyRng = sh.Rows("1")
 To copy a whole row or rows( use "1:8" then)
 Copy only values or everything
 Replace this :
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats
 Application.CutCopyMode = False
 End With
 With:
 With CopyRng
 DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A").Resize(.Rows.Count, \_
 .Columns.Count).Value = .Value
 End With
 If you only want to copy the values.
 Or Replace this :
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
 .PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats
 Application.CutCopyMode = False
 End With
 With:
 CopyRng.Copy DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")
 If you want to copy everything.
 Do not loop through all sheets in the workbook
 
 Tip 1:
 Replace this line:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 With:
 If LCase(Left(sh.Name, 4)) = "week" Then
 If you want to copy only from sheets with a name that start with week.
 Tip 2:
 Replace this line:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 with:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name And sh.Visible = True Then
 If you want to copy only from the visible sheets in your workbook.
 Tip 3:
 Replace this line:
 For Each sh In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
 With:
 For Each sh In ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(Array("Sheet1", "Sheet3"))
 And remove this two lines:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then and End If before Next
 If you want to copy only from sheets that are in the Array.
 Tip 4:
 Replace this line:
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 With:
 If IsError(Application.Match(sh.Name, \_
 Array(DestSh.Name, "Total Sheet", "Menu Sheet"), 0)) Then
 If you want to exclude more sheets then the DestSh.
 Copy from row 2 till the last row with data
 Note: This example use the function LastRow
 Note: You can use the tips above also in this example
 In example 1 you can see that you can copy all cells on a worksheet
with this line:
 Set CopyRng = sh.UsedRange
 But what if we do not want to copy the same header row each time.
 The example below will copy from row 2 till the last row with data on
each sheet
 Change the start row in the macro if you want to start in a different
row.
 'Fill in the start row
 StartRow = 2
 If you want to copy the header row in the first row of the
RDBMergeSheet
 then copy the code below if each worksheet have the same headers after
 this line : If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 'Copy header row, change the range if you use more columns
 If WorksheetFunction.CountA(DestSh.UsedRange) = 0 Then
 sh.Range("A1:Z1").Copy DestSh.Range("A1")
 End If
 Sub CopyDataWithoutHeaders()
 Dim sh As Worksheet
 Dim DestSh As Worksheet
 Dim Last As Long
 Dim shLast As Long
 Dim CopyRng As Range
 Dim StartRow As Long
 With Application
 .ScreenUpdating = False
 .EnableEvents = False
 End With
 'Delete the sheet "RDBMergeSheet" if it exist

 'Add a worksheet with the name "RDBMergeSheet"

 'loop through all worksheets and copy the data to the DestSh
 For Each sh In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
 If sh.Name <> DestSh.Name Then
 'Find the last row with data on the DestSh and sh
 Last = LastRow(DestSh)
 shLast = LastRow(sh)
 'If sh is not empty and if the last row >= StartRow copy
the CopyRng
 If shLast > 0 And shLast >= StartRow Then
 'Set the range that you want to copy
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range(sh.Rows(StartRow),
sh.Rows(shLast))
 'Test if there enough rows in the DestSh to copy all
the data
 If Last + CopyRng.Rows.Count > DestSh.Rows.Count Then
 MsgBox "There are not enough rows in the Destsh"
 GoTo ExitTheSub
 End If
 'This example copies values/formats, if you only want
to copy the
 'values or want to copy everything look below example 1
on this page
 CopyRng.Copy
 With DestSh.Cells(Last + 1, "A")

 Application.CutCopyMode = False

 End If
 End If
 Next

 Application.Goto DestSh.Cells(1)
 'AutoFit the column width in the DestSh sheet
 DestSh.Columns.AutoFit
 With Application
 .ScreenUpdating = True
 .EnableEvents = True
 End With
 End Sub
 Copy a range/column after the last column with data
 Note: This example use the function LastCol
 This example copy column A from each sheet after the last column with
data on the DestSh.
 I use A:A to copy the whole column but you can also use a range like
A1:A10
 Use A:C if you want to copy more columns.
 Change it here
 'Fill in the column(s) that you want to copy
 Set CopyRng = sh.Range("A:A")
 Remember that Excel 97-2003 have only 256 columns.
 Excel 2007 has 16384 columns.

**** import batch txt files

 Copy every TXT or CSV file that you select in a new worksheet of a
newly created workbook
 Ron de Bruin (last update 30-Aug-2007)
 Go back to the Excel tips page
 Example for TXT files
 The macro below will copy every txt file that you select with
GetOpenFilename to your workbook.
 If you select ten txt files in the folder then you end up with 10 new
worksheets in
 your workbook. Each worksheet will have the name of the txt file.
 Note: you can hold the CTRL key if you want to select more files or use
the Shift key to select
 a block of files in GetOpenFilename. Tip: With Ctrl a you select all
files in the folder.
 I did not use all the properties for QueryTables in my macro because a
lot of them are already
 what I want by default. If you don't get the results you want then
record a macro when you
 perform the action manually.
 Then look at the recorded code and add the code lines to the macro
Get\_TXT\_Files.
 Copy all code in a normal module of your workbook
 Alt F11
 Insert Module
 Paste the code
 Alt q to go back to Excel
 Alt F8 to open the macro dialog
 Select the macro and press Run
 This example is for Delimited txt files, see the example below this
macro for FixedWidth
 Read the information in the macro Get\_TXT\_Files before you try the
macro.
 Maybe you want to use a different delimiter or change the format of a
column.

 How do I create a PERSONAL.XLS(B) or Add-in
 Ron de Bruin (last update 8-april-2008)
 Go back to the Excel tips page
 PERSONAL.XLS(B)
 If you want that certain code is available in all your workbooks, then
use your
 PERSONAL.XLS or in Excel 2007 your PERSONAL.XLSB file.
 What is it:
 This is a hidden workbook that opens when you start Excel.
 The code you copy in this workbook is available in all workbooks you
have opened in Excel.
 Where is it:
 If it exists, you can find the file in the Excel startup folder.
 C:\Documents and Settings\Ron\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART
 In Vista look here
 C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART
 Note: Ron is the username in the path above
 With code you find the correct path on your machine with this line
 1) Open excel
 2) Hit alt-F11 to get to the VBE
 3) Hit ctrl-g to see the immediate window and type this:
 4) ?Application.StartupPath
 You'll see the startup path returned
 How do you create the file if it does not exist:
 If it does not exist then record a dummy macro and change the "Store
macro in:"
 drop down to Personal Macro Workbook. Excel creates the file for you
then in the correct folder.
 Excel 97-2003: Tools>Macro...Record New Macro.
 Excel 2007: On the "Developer" tab click on Record macro.
 To display the "Developer" tab go to Office Button >Excel
Options...Popular.
 Or faster click the button on the bottom left corner of the Excel 2007
window to start the recording.
 Press OK in the dialog that you see now
 Because we only want Excel to create the file for us we can stop the
recording directly.
 Press the Stop Recording button or use Tools>Macros...Stop recording in
Excel 97-2003
 In Excel 2007 you can press the Stop Recording Button on the Developers
tab or click the
 button on the bottom left corner of the Excel window to stop the
recording
 Now we use Alt F11 to go to the VBE editor(working in all Excel
versions)
 Or:
 Excel 97-2003: Tools>Macro>Visual Basic Editor.
 Excel 2007: Click on the button named "Visual Basic" on the "Developer"
tab
 Make the file ready
 Note: I use the name PERSONAL.XLS in the text below but in Excel 2007
the name is PERSONAL.XLSB
 To be sure that we see the Project Window, Code window and the
Properties window we use one time.
 Ctrl-r (to see the project explorer)
 F7 (to view the code window)
 F4 (to view the properties window)
 Now we give the PERSONAL.XLS a unique project name (Default is
VBAProject)
 Select the PERSONAL.XLS in the project window and change the name in
the properties window.
 
 Now use Ctrl-s or File>Save in the VBA editor to save the PERSONAL.XLS.
 We are now ready to add code (macros or/and functions) to this file so
we can use it in all the workbooks.
 With Insert>Module in the VBA editor you can also add more modules to
the PERSONAL.XLS.
 This way you can organize your code in this file.
 Use only code here that you use yourself and not code that you use in
files that you distribute to other users.
 In this case add the code in the modules of the workbook itself. Or see
the ”Add-in” part on this page.
 Example 1: Macro
 Public Sub Test()
 MsgBox "Insert your favorite code here"
 End Sub
 1) Select the PERSONAL.XLS in the project window and click on the +
before it
 2) Then click on the + before Modules
 3) Double click on Module1 to open the code window on the right
 4) We copy/paste the example macro in this module.
 5) Now use Ctrl-s or File>Save in the VBA editor to save the
PERSONAL.XLS.
 6) We use Alt--q to go back to Excel or use "File >Close and Return to
Microsoft Excel".
 7) You can run the macro then with Alt-F8 or Tools>Macro...Macros /
Developer tab>Macros
 Note: You can delete the dummy macro that we used to create the
PERSONAL.XLS.
 Example 2: Function
 This function gives you the ISO week number that is used in Europe and
a lot of other countries.
 Note: This function is not available in Excel.
 Public Function IsoWeekNum(d1 As Date) As Integer
 ' Daniel Maher
 Dim d2 As Long
 d2 = DateSerial(Year(d1 - Weekday(d1 - 1) + 4), 1, 3)
 IsoWeekNum = Int((d1 - d2 + Weekday(d2) + 5) / 7)
 End Function
 1) Select the PERSONAL.XLS in the project window and click on the +
before it
 2) Then click on the + before Modules
 3) Double click on Module1 to open the code window on the right
 4) We copy/paste the example function in this module.
 5) Now use Ctrl-s or File>Save in the VBA editor to save the
PERSONAL.XLS.
 6) We use Alt--q to go back to Excel or use "File >Close and Return to
Microsoft Excel".
 Now we can use this in a worksheet cell with the date in A1
 =PERSONAL.XLS!IsoWeekNum(A1)
 If you create a reference in the workbook where you want to use it to
your
 PERSONAL.XLS then you can use
 =IsoWeekNum(A1)
 Go to Tools>References in the VBA editor with the workbook selected in
the project window and
 add a check mark before RonPersonal. (Save the workbook then)
 Problems with the PERSONAL.XLS(B) workbook
 What to do if your PERSONAL.XLS(B) is visible
 When you open Excel and you see PERSONAL.XLS(B) in the title bar you
can use this to hide it.
 Excel 97-2003: Window>Hide
 Excel 2007 : On the View tab in the window group choose Hide
 Then close Excel and say Yes to save the changes to your PERSONAL file.
 PERSONAL.XLS(B) will not open but is in the correct location
 When Excel think the file is corrupt it can disable the file.
 You can re-enable it here but if it is really corrupted replace it with
a backup.
 Excel 2002-2003: Help>About MS Excel>Disabled items
 Excel 2007 : Office button>Excel Options..Add-ins
 In the "Manage:" dropdown (bottom of the
dialog)
 Choose "Disabled Items
 Go
 Use a Add-in
 You can also create an add-in to store code that you want to use in all
workbooks.
 (A add-in is also a hidden workbook like PERSONAL.XLS)
 This is a good way if you want to distribute code to other users. Open
a new workbook and copy
 the code in this workbook and then use File>Save As or Office
Button>Save As to save it as
 Excel Add-in, use a name like MyUtility.xla for example(xlam in Excel
2007).
 Before you save it give MyUtility.xla a unique project name (Default is
VBAProject)
 see how I do it above with the PERSONAL.XLS(B).
 You can install the add-in like this:
 1) Tools>Add-ins in Excel 97-2003
 Office Button>Excel Options..Add-ins and then Manage Excel
add-ins...Go in Excel 2007
 Or use the shortcut (Alt ti example for the English version)
 2) Browse to the XLA(M) file
 3) OK
 4) Add a check mark before it in the list
 5) OK
 Now every time you open Excel it opens the add-in and you can use the
code in all workbooks.
 Note: Add-in macros not show up in Alt-F8 or in Tools>Macro...Macros in
97-2003 or in
 Developer tab>Macros in 2007. You must make a menu for the macros in
the add-in.
 Create your own menu/toolbar to run the code

 How to customize menus and menu bars in Excel

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;830502&Product=xlw
 Excel 2007
 In Excel 2007 check out this example for your PERSONAL.XLSB
 http://www.rondebruin.nl/qat.htm
 If you want to change the ribbon check out this page
 http://www.rondebruin.nl/ribbon.htm
 Note: It is not possible to use XML to create a menu for your
PERSONAL.XLSB.
 Use the QAT example then
 

**** combine multiple columns to one

to do that:
 make sure your columns are formatted as general
 in a new column (again general) go to the first cell and choose the
formula concentrate (under the text catagory)
 choose the colums to join

**** how to apply a formula to the entire column in excel other than
draging it down

As long as there are no blank rows, go to the first cell, then hover
your mouse to the lower right hand corner of that cell until the cursor
becomes a black plus, then double click. It will copy the formula down
until it finds a break (blank cell) in what you're trying to copy.

*** prepare word tables from excel

**** CONCATENATE example

= CONCATENATE(ROUND(I21,2), " ± ", ROUND(J21,2))
 where:
 I21-is the first cell used
 ,2-is the number of digits to round to
 J21-is the second cell used
 " ± "- is the text symbol between the 2 numbers

**** nice CI example

use this command to create nice CI's
 =CONCATENATE("(",ROUND(K3,2),";",ROUND(L3,2),")")

*** Confidence intervals/OR/Precent

**** calculate OR

for the Odds ratio use the coefficient value (B3)
 Note: the example here is per a 10 unit increase and thus the values
are multiplied by 10
 *=(EXP(B3*10))*
 for the CI OR use the coefficient value (B3) and Std.Error (C3)
 *Low*
 *=EXP((B3-1.96*C3)*10)*
 *High*
 *=EXP((B3+1.96*C3)*10)*
*** change sheet sides (language heb/eng)
 
** Powerpoint
*** make a global change to all the fonts in the presentation
PowerPoint has a convenient feature that allows you to make a global change to all the fonts in the presentation at one time.

    PowerPoint 2010 and 2007 - In the Editing section, at the right side of the Home tab of the ribbon, click the Replace > Replace Fonts...
    PowerPoint 2003 - Choose Format > Replace Fonts... from the menu.

    In the Replace Font dialog box, under the heading Replace, select the font you wish to change from the drop down list of fonts in this presentation.

    Under the heading With, select the new font for the presentation.

    Click the Replace button. All the text in the entire presentation that used the original font is now replaced with your new choice.

    Repeat the process if your presentation contains a second font that you wish to change.
** Endnote

*** export endnote library

Export references from Endnote in ``Endnote Export'' format
 Endnote has no built-in mechanism to generate Labels, so we'll use an
easily parsed plain text version of the library.
 Open the Endnote library containing your references.
 Select all refs.
 Select Edit [IMAGE png] Output Styles [IMAGE png] Open Style
Manager and set style to ``EndNote Export''.
 Export refs to a text file by selecting File [IMAGE png] Export...
(make sure ``Text Only''is chosen under ``Save file as type'')
 Close the Endnote library.

*** import a journal style

go to the end note site and download the specific journal style
 save it in the end note folder under the style folder
 edit and enable it under the style manager
** Word

*** create line numbering

** Windows
*** create symlink

download the software Link Shell Extension

[[http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html][http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html]]
 install it and then through the windows explorer (the default windows
File manager) do this
 pick a file/folder you want to use as the base, right click and issue
 'pick source'
 then go to where you want the symlink to be and right click
 "Drops As.."
 and then in the submenu choose your need , usually its:
 Symbolic link
 if you want to cancell in the middle and start again issue:
 Cancel link creation
 Note: you can rename the symlink to anything you want after creating it

**** delete all files from library

i

f you want to delete all your documents and references, you can always
do this by selecting 'All' documents on your web library. The first 20
documents will be selected; however, you have the option of selecting
all the documents existing in your library by clicking on 'Select all xx
documents' (the link next to the text 'All 20 documents on this page are
selected').

Once this is done you need to click on 'Delete Documents' at the top, to
send these documents to the Trash. To delete them definitely from your
web library, you must then click on 'All Deleted Documents' and then on
'Empty Trash'.

Finally, you need to sync with Mendeley Desktop to empty your local
library.

** Dropbox
*** recover deleted files

there is another way to restore files from your computer in case the above method fails. Dropbox also keeps a hidden cache of files in a backup storage within the Dropbox settings. In Windows Vista and Windows 7 open a new Windows Explorer window or folder. Copy and paste the following line to the location bar at the top of the folder and press Enter:

%HOMEPATH%\Dropbox\.dropbox.cache

This will open your Dropbox cache within the Application Data folder. To restore a file, drag it out of this cache folder into another folder or onto your desktop.
