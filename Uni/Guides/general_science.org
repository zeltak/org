**** ppm

"Parts per" is a convenient notation used for low and very low
concentrations. Generally speaking it is very similar to weight by
weight percentage - 1% w/w means 1 gram of substance per every 100 g of
sample and it is (although very rarely) named pph - parts per hundred.
Other abbreviations stand for:
 ppm   parts per milion (106)
 ppb   parts per bilion (109)
 ppt   parts per trillion (1012)
 ppq   parts per quadrilion (1015)

** conversions

*** convert population density from km to per square mile

1 km = 0.62 miles
 1 km\^2 = 0.62\^2 miles\^2
 So IE 60.72 people in 1 sq km
 = 60.72 people in 0.62\^2 sq miles
 = 60.72 / 0.62\^2 people per sq mile
 = 157.96 people per sq mile

*** convert dewpopint and temp to abolute humidaty

WVP = 6.11 * 10^{(7.5 * Td) / (237.7 + Td)}
 AH = 100000 × WVP / (273.15 + T) × 461.5
 WVP = water vapor pressure, millibars
 Td = dew point temperature, °C
 AH = absolute humidity, g/m3
 T = ambient or dry bulb temperature, °C
 *here's the SAS code:*
 wvp\_mb = 6.11* (10**(((7.5 * dp\_c)/(237.7 + dp\_c))));
 ah\_gm3 = (1000* (100 * wvp\_mb))/((273.15 + te\_c)* 461.5);
