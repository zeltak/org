** Data, Experiments, Studies

*** Cross sectional study

Cross sectional studies are those that record data from a sample of
subjects at a given point in time.

Cross-sectional Data:C

ross-sectional data refer to observations of many individuals (subjects,
objects) at a given time.A simple example of cross-sectional data is the
gross annual income for each of 1000 randomly chosen households in New
York City for the year 2000.
 Consider, for example, a set of 1000 households randomly chosen from
all households of New York City. The observed variable is the gross
annual income.
 A set of 1000 annual income values for year 1995 for each household is
an example
of [[http://www.statistics.com/resources/glossary/c/crossdat.php][ ]]oss-sectional
data . From such data one could derive information on how income was
distributed among households in New York City in 1995.

*** Longitudinal study

Longitudinal analysis is concerned with statistical inference
from [[http://www.statistics.com/resources/glossary/l/longdat.php][longitudinal
data]].
 Longitudinal studies are those that record data for subjects or
variables over time.
 If a longitudinal study uses the same subjects at each point where data
are recorded, it is a [[#8wJ-MChsEs34tIs6Pa1F2A][panel study]] .
 If a longitudinal study samples from the same group at each point where
data are recorded, it is a [[#N0z.WxuMzV4Pg5rtyQ0R5g][cohort study]].
 Longitudinal Data:
 Longitudinal data refer to observations of a given unit made over time.
Such data can usually be represented as a time-series and, therefore,
they are often referred to as time series data.
 A simple example of longitudinal data is the average gross annual
income of, say, 1000 households randomly chosen from New York City for
years 1991-2000. Such data could be represented as a time series of 10
values (each value being the average gross income of all 1000 households
for one year).

*** Cohort study

Cohort study:
 A cohort study is a longitudinal study that identifies a population or
large group (a "cohort") then draws a sample from the population at
various points in time and records data for the sample.

*** Panel study

Panel study:
 A panel study is a longitudinal study that selects a group of subjects
then records data for each member of the group at various points in
time. See also panel data .
 Panel Data:
 A panel data set refers contains observations on a number of units
(e.g. subjects, objects) over time. Thus, panel data has characteristics
of both longitudinal data and cross-sectional data .
 A simple example of panel data is the values of the gross annual income
for each of 1000 randomly chosen households in New York City collected
for each of 10 years from 1991 to 2000. Such data can be represented as
a set of double-indexed values {Vij; i=1,...,10, j=1,...,1000} .

** Rates, prevelance, proportions

 *induction period:* deﬁned as the period of time from causal action
until disease occurrence.
 *latent period :* The time interval between disease occurrence and
detection.
 *Hill* suggested the following aspects of an association be considered
 in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations: (1)
strength,
 (2) consistency, (3) speciﬁcity, (4) temporality, (5) biologic
gradient, (6) plausibility,
 (7) coherence, (8) experimental evidence, and (9) analogy.
 *Incidence rate*measures the occurrence of *new* disease per unit of
person-time.*
**
**Prevalence*, a measure of status rather than of newly occurring
disease, measures the *proportion of people who have disease* at a
speciﬁc time.
 *Incidence times* are simply the times at which new disease occurs
among population members.
 *Incidence proportion* measures the proportion of people who develop
new disease during a speciﬁed period of time.

** Case crossover

*** intro

The case crossover design was introduced in 1991 by Maclure M (Am J
Epidemiol 1991;133:144-53) to study the transient effect of brief
exposure on the occurrence of a rare acute-onset disease.
 The argument is that if there are precipitating events, these events
should occur much more frequently during a period immediately prior to
the onset of disease than at a similar period which is more distant from
the disease onset. For example, it has been reported that physical
stress and mental stress may trigger sudden cardiac death. If this is
true, one would find that sudden cardiac death occurred more frequently
during or shortly after strenuous physical activity, or that there was
an increase in informant-reported life stress either acutely before
sudden cardiac death or during the weeks before the event. Another
example is the alcohol consumption and injury. The effect of alcohol is
transient and alcohol use is usually associated with injury. Therefore,
one would expect that the alcohol consumption prior to injury increases
the risk of injury.   
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Pasted.jpg]]
 For example, to find out what might trigger the onset of myocardial
infarction, we may wonder if the patient endured certain heavy physical
activity, or if he/she consumed specific type of food right before the
disease. If we can gather the so called "exposure" information from many
patients, it is possible to determine the effect of the event or
"attitude" on the onset of disease.
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_bklqKLwr0vLS-aBS2iFAlg_0001.jpg]]
  Like most of the epidemiological studies we need to have control data
to determine what "unusual" meant. However, we can't do the comparison
among individuals since everyone is different. Rather, the comparison
should be done within the individual. In another words, we will compare
the individual's activity before the disease onset to his/her usual
activity. Thus here, we have a "case" component and also a "control"
component, but the information of both components will come from the
same individual.
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_bklqKLwr0vLS-aBS2iFAlg_0002.jpg]]
 We define the "case component" as hazard period which is the time
period right before the disease or event onset; and the "control
component" as control period which is a specified time interval other
than the hazard period. The information of the individual "exposed to
certain activity or agent during the hazard period and control period
will be compared. If we collect such information from many subjects who
had the disease or event, we can test for consistent relationships
between the disease and the exposure.

*** case crossover desgin

[[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_3jEK0KCSJJZHq8.d6PQ8Bw_0001.jpg]]
 - The term "crossover" is mainly used to describe experiments in which
all individuals pass through both the treatment and placebo phases.
  In the case crossover design, the treatment phase is the hazard period
and placebo phase is the control period. Since there are a hazard period
and a control period and each individual provides the exposure
information for both hazard and control periods, case crossover design
can be viewed as a matched case-control study design where it involves
cases only and each individual serves as his/her own control.
 - On the other hand, the case crossover study can also be viewed as a
retrospective cohort study as the control data are not necessarily the
"counts", they can be units of exposure person-time (this will be
illustrated in slides 13, 16, 20). When it is this case, the analysis
for the study can be treated as a pooled analysis of several cohort
studies each with a sample size of one.
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_3jEK0KCSJJZHq8.d6PQ8Bw_0002.jpg]]
 - In summary, case crossover design is used when a brief exposure
causes a transient change in risk of an acute onset event. The event can
be the onset of type I diabetes, a motor vehicle accident, or an injury.
The "exposure" can be another disease or certain activity, such as
having an infectious disease, conducting a certain unusual task, or
using a certain device. There is a hazard period associated with the
event onset and the exposure information in the hazard period is
compared with the control data from a selected control period.

*** What is effect period of the exposure?

[[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_Nab8pC9wklEkvqUGskAcjw_0001.jpg]]
 The effect period after the exposure is the time period during which
there is either excess or reduced risk due to the exposure. If there is
a delay before impact of the exposure and/or there is carry over time of
the exposure, the effect period is not exactly the same as the period of
exposure. Thus, the effect period is defined as the difference of those
two. Usually, one can assume the minimum delay before impact as "0".
 There is an effect period associated with every episode of exposure.
For example, if the effect of certain physical activity lasts for 30
minutes, then every time after the physical activity, the following 30
minutes will be considered as the effect period. That is during those 30
minutes the individual will have higher risk of the event, say MI.   

*** What is hazard period?

 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_HuB2dIZcZOF0KKQam2QZkQ_0001.jpg]]
 The hazard period is the period of time right before the event onset
and its length is the same as the length of exposure effect period. It
is hypothesized that, during this period of time, the individual is most
likely exposed to certain agent which triggers the onset of the event.
Thus we are interested to know if the individuals had exposure in this
period of time or not.   
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_HuB2dIZcZOF0KKQam2QZkQ_0002.jpg]]
  The length of the hazard period can be decided according to the
investigator's past experience. The length of this period is very
important. If the duration is overestimated, many "false exposures" will
become "exposures". If the duration is underestimated, some of the "true
exposures" will be excluded. When either of these occur, the association
between the event and exposure can't be evaluated correctly.

*** control data

[[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_9LDXr7w-YsiaEvbGbYK73Q_0001.jpg]]
  - From the earlier slides we know that the exposure information in the
hazard period will be compared to the exposure information in the
control data. There are 2 types of control data we can use in a case
crossover analysis. The first type of data and also the most used is the
exposure information from a "control period" which has the same length
as the hazard period but at different time point. For example, if the
length of hazard period is 5 hours, the control period is also a 5-hour
period but it can be from the day before or two days before.
 - The second type of control data is the exposure information from the
past, it can be from the past month or past year. The analysis based on
this type of control data will be more complicated.
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_9LDXr7w-YsiaEvbGbYK73Q_0002.jpg]]
     Here the myocardial infarction study by Mittleman MA (1993) is used
to illustrate the types of control data we can use in a case crossover
study. In the study they investigated the effect of heavy physical
exertion on the onset of MI and whether the risk of MI can be modified
by regular physical exertion. Thus here, the "event" is the onset of MI,
and the "exposure" is heavy physical exertion. The effect of physical
exertion is assumed to last one hour, and the hazard period is one hour
before the onset of MI.
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_9LDXr7w-YsiaEvbGbYK73Q_0003.jpg]]
     The first type of control data is the exertion information from a
one-hour control period which is defined as at the same hour but on the
day before the onset of MI. For example, if a patient had MI at 9pm, May
28, the control period will be at 8-9pm, May 27. The physical exertion
information (yes or no) was collected during these 2 time periods.
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_9LDXr7w-YsiaEvbGbYK73Q_0004.jpg]]
 The other type of control data they used is the patient's usual
frequency of physical exertion over the past year. The idea is to
compare the amount of time exposed to exertion and the amount of time
not exposed to exertion over the past with the information of whether
there was exertion during the hazard period. Since here "person-time"
exposed to exertion is used, the design is rather like a "cohort" study
than a traditional case-control study, and the analysis for this type of
control data will also be more like a cohort study analysis.

*** Analysis: If the control data were from a comparable control period

[[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_bsvx3WzUSJsDlauAwvGQyQ_0001.jpg]]
 Now we will talk about how to analyze the hazard period data and
control data to estimate the effect of exposure on the outcome. Since
there are 2 types of control data, we will also have 2 types of
analyses. 
 If the control data are from a comparable control period, the analysis
will be the same as that for a matched case-control study. However,
instead of concordant and discordant pairs of study subjects in a
matched case-control study, here we will have concordant and discordant
pairs of exposures from the hazard period and control period. That is,
the pairs are made up of two intervals(hazard period and control period)
for each subject, and the pairs are either concordant or discordant for
exposure. After arranging the data in a 2 by 2 table as shown in the
slide, we can just use the standard method for matched case-control to
get the odds ratio.   

*** Discussion

[[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_g.zza7WkUcN5V5hpa2wkKw_0001.jpg]]
  - The important assumptions in a case crossover design include that
the exposure should be brief, the time between exposure and event onset
should be short and there is little carryover effect on the exposure.
Therefore, this study design can't be used, for example, to evaluate an
intervention which is anticipated to cause cumulative changes in the
participants, or to study on the progression of a chronic disease.
 - Because of the above conditions, the results from a case crossover
analysis only represent short-term risk but not cumulative risk, and
relative risk but not absolute risk.
 [[Epidemiology_files/img/Image_g.zza7WkUcN5V5hpa2wkKw_0002.jpg]]
 - The exposure information will be provided by the study participants
or their next of kin (if the outcome is mortality). Recall bias may very
possible occur when the information is not "recorded" and is recalled by
the individuals. 
 - In the design each individual serves as his/her own control and this
can eliminate confounding by subject characteristics. But if there is
certain characteristics which change over time in the individual, self
control can't adjust for this. For example, an individual usually
drinking coffee after exercise represents a within-individual
confounding, since it is difficult to distinguish whether coffee
consumption or exercise causes the outcome of interest. If this happens,
one can stratify the data or use conditional logistic regression to
adjust for the confounding.   
** Environmental Epi
*** exposure 
**** Exposure error 
three types of exposure measurement error in longitudinal studies of air pollution and health, such as those cited above:
1.The first error is derived from the difference between the daily personal exposures of each individual and the daily community-average personal exposure.
2.The second error stems from the difference between the daily community average personal exposure and the true ambient concentration.
3. the third component of error is from the difference between the measured and the true ambient concentration (i.e., measurement error). 

The first and third types of errors are of the Berkson type. Since Berkson measurement error is such that the true exposure is distributed around the measured value, this form of error will not lead to biased health effect estimates for a given pollutant, but does make the association less significant since relying on the mismeasured surrogate is not as informative as having true exposure.
The second type of error is termed classical and will bias the relative risk.
Upward bias can occur in rare settings where the ratio of the amount of measurement error in PM to the measurement error in the other pollutants is high and the correlations amongthe pollutants are extreme. Hence, the authors concluded that observed PM health risk estimates were likely not biased away from 0 by measurement error.
The second type of error will be influenced by pollution from indoor sources and by the difference between the ambient concentration and the ambient exposure (the ambient component of personal exposure). Since indoor-generated sources are generally uncorrelated with the ambient concentrations, the indoor-generated component of personal exposure will not affect the relative risk due to ambient pollution.  
**** scales of Human exposure
Human exposures can be decomposed to three components: regional, urban background, and microscale.

The impact of the regional sources is uniform across the study area.

The urban background represents the collective emissions of sources within the study area.
Exposures to these emissions depend on the distribution of local sources, their geographic location and the prevailing meteorological conditions. Although these exposures vary by space, their changes are very smooth. 

Finally, the microscale exposures are directly related to nearby sources located within a few hundred meters. These exposures exhibit pronounced spatial variability.

In our study we use two exposure metrics: the first, is the distance of the subject residence from the closest roadway, which can be used as a surrogate of microscale exposures to nearby traffic, and

the second is the PM2.5 exposure at outside the subject residence. This encompasses exposures associated with both nearby traffic and urban background.  Therefore, gradients of the two exposure metrics amongst the cohort subjects will represent differences of the impact of nearby traffic sources, and nearby sources plus urban background. Note that the urban background reflects traffic emissions as well as those from other sources such as home heating, air port and seaport, and a host of small sources.

The above definitions assume that exposures were estimated mostly during the same time period. otherwise, gradients in the two exposure metrics could also reflect temporal trends in emissions of local and/or distant sources. In conclusion, distance from the nearest roadway and pm25 mass estimates are two different exposure metrics where the former represents s a fraction of the latter.

**** chronic vs accute variablity in exposure assesmnt 
  for chronic we care about spatial variability
  for acute we care about temporal variability 

*** PM
**** basics
PM includes both primary particles such as soot and dust from combustion sources and agricultural burning activities, and secondary particles such as sulfate and nitrate generated through chemical reactions in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and ammonia emitted from power plants, industries, automobiles, and agriculture
*** AOD and satellite data
**** aod-pm relatinship
 
However, some discrepancy between AOD and PM were also observed (Koelemeijer et al., 2006; Emili et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011). The reasons for the discrepancy are two-fold: one is the limitation of inversion algorithm for AOD retrieval, potentially causing large bias over areas with high reflectance such as cirrus cloud, urban built-up area, and snow/ice surface etc. Another reason is aerosol composition (e.g. type, size, proportion and vertical distribution) and hygroscopic growth. Nonetheless, AOD has been wildly considered as a good surrogate for surface PM (Wang and Christopher, 2003), especially AOD at 0.47 , which previously reported to have the highest correlation with PM2.5 (Zeeshan and Kim Oanh, 2014).

**** advantages of using AOD data over LUR
the use of physical measuremtns gives us the ability to predict in areas far from physics monitors (such as >30km etc) and reach rural area
use of AOD gives us daily predctions over space where LUR cannot
monitors in modest numbers some areas may be under or unrepresented in calibrating the land use regression.

using Aod results in more parsimonious models then LUR- leaves out some Land use terms used in later health outcome models that can create bias since they are included in the exposure
