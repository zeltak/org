  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Long- and short-term exposures to air pollution, especially fine particulate matter ({PM(2.5))}, have been linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. One hypothesized mechanism for these associations involves microvascular effects. Retinal photography provides a novel, in vivo approach to examine the association of air pollution with changes in the human microvasculature. {METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS:} Chronic and acute associations between residential air pollution concentrations and retinal vessel diameters, expressed as central retinal arteriolar equivalents ({CRAE)} and central retinal venular equivalents ({CRVE)}, were examined using digital retinal images taken in Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ({MESA)} participants between 2002 and 2003. Study participants (46 to 87 years of age) were without clinical cardiovascular disease at the baseline examination (2000-2002). Long-term outdoor concentrations of {PM(2.5)} were estimated at each participant's home for the 2 years preceding the clinical exam using a spatio-temporal model. Short-term concentrations were assigned using outdoor measurements on the day preceding the clinical exam. Residential proximity to roadways was also used as an indicator of long-term traffic exposures. All associations were examined using linear regression models adjusted for subject-specific age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, body mass index, family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes status, serum cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, emphysema, C-reactive protein, medication use, and fellow vessel diameter. Short-term associations were further controlled for weather and seasonality. Among the 4,607 participants with complete data, {CRAE} were found to be narrower among persons residing in regions with increased long- and short-term levels of {PM(2.5).} These relationships were observed in a joint exposure model with -0.8 microm (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} -1.1 to -0.5) and -0.4 microm (95\% {CI} -0.8 to 0.1) decreases in {CRAE} per interquartile increases in long- (3 microg/m(3)) and short-term (9 microg/m(3)) {PM(2.5)} levels, respectively. These reductions in {CRAE} are equivalent to 7- and 3-year increases in age in the same cohort. Similarly, living near a major road was also associated with a -0.7 microm decrease (95\% {CI} -1.4 to 0.1) in {CRAE.} Although the chronic association with {CRAE} was largely influenced by differences in exposure between cities, this relationship was generally robust to control for city-level covariates and no significant differences were observed between cities. Wider {CRVE} were associated with living in areas of higher {PM(2.5)} concentrations, but these findings were less robust and not supported by the presence of consistent acute associations with {PM(2.5).} {CONCLUSIONS:} Residing in regions with higher air pollution concentrations and experiencing daily increases in air pollution were each associated with narrower retinal arteriolar diameters in older individuals. These findings support the hypothesis that important vascular phenomena are associated with small increases in short-term or long-term air pollution exposures, even at current exposure levels, and further corroborate reported associations between air pollution and the development and exacerbation of clinical cardiovascular disease.

  Abstract                 = {Habitual sleep duration varies greatly among individuals. The physiological basis of this variation is unknown. We sought to determine whether individual differences in sleep duration are associated with systematic differences in the duration of the biological night that is programmed by the circadian pacemaker and reflected in the nocturnal interval of circadian rhythms in neuroendocrine function, body temperature, and arousal. Ten young, healthy long sleepers (sleep duration {\textgreater}9 h) and 14 short sleepers ({\textless}6 h) were studied under constant environmental conditions and in the absence of sleep. The nocturnal intervals of high plasma melatonin levels, increasing cortisol levels, low body temperature, and increasing sleepiness were longer in long sleepers than in short sleepers. The maxima in cortisol and sleepiness exhibited a close relationship to habitual wake-up time, which occurred approximately 2.5 h later in long sleepers than in short sleepers. It is concluded that the circadian pacemaker programs a longer biological night in long sleepers than in short sleepers. We propose that individual differences in the circadian pacemaker's program may contribute to the variability of sleep duration in the general population. The persistence or inertia of an individual's circadian program, as was evident in constant conditions, may underlie the commonly experienced difficulty of changing habitual sleep duration willfully.},

In this study, we investigated the pathologic effects of maternal smoking and air pollution on the pathogenesis of chorangiosis. We investigated 92 placentas macroscopically and microscopically over a 3-month period (March 2006-May 2006) at Denizli State Hospital to identify the frequency of chorangiosis and the potential role of maternal smoking and air pollution. Placental changes were examined by light microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin ({H\&E)} staining and immunohistochemical evaluation of {CD} 34 and {CD} 68; muscle-specific actin was used to confirm the diagnosis. Among the 92 mothers included in the study, 33 were smokers (group I), 31 were thought to have been exposed to air pollution (group {II)}, and 28 were living in rural areas free of air pollution and maternal smoking (group {III).} Chorangiosis was found in 14\% (13/92) of all placentas: 7 (53.8\%) cases were assigned to group I, 5 (38.5\%) to group {II}, and 1 (7.7\%) to group {III.} Vascular changes were found mainly in the smoking and air pollution groups. There appeared to be no correlation of these vascular changes with placental weight, parity, gestational age, major congenital anomalies, and maternal factors, including diabetes and pre-eclampsia. We presume that smoking and air pollution may contribute to the development of chorangiosis. We suggest that chorangiosis may be an adaptive response to maternal hypoxia, and studies addressing the role of smoking and air pollution in chorangiosis may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this condition.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper advances the concept of a coupled social-ecological system ({SES)}, where human and biophysical systems are closely linked, to examine and explain variations in landscape values perceived by people in their region. In this paper, we describe an approach that allows the mapping of {SES} by linking survey research with geographic information systems ({GIS)} to provide spatial representations of social and ecological system convergence. Using survey data that measured landscape values from multiple communities on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, we identify geographical areas where both human-perceived and physically measured ecological values overlap and are referred to as social-ecological "hotspots". Community landscape values, collected as point data, were used to generate point density maps to produce hotspot surfaces for each value. These value surfaces were spatially cross-correlated with other communities' value surfaces and with an ecological map layer (net primary productivity) to demonstrate social-ecological mapping. Moderate spatial cross-correlation coefficients were found between most landscape values by community with 18 hotspot surfaces pairings exhibiting strong positive spatial cross correlations. Moderately significant, positive linear relationships were found between perceived biological values and net primary productivity for three of six communities. The exploratory spatial analysis presented in this paper is a first step in identifying and describing the presence of {SES} in a regional context. We conclude the paper by discussing the potential managerial and ecological implications of coupled social-ecological systems including system resilience and vulnerability, and the limitations of the approach that need to be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer and is the leading cause of cancer death among women. Methods To describe global trends, we compared age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates over three decades (from 1973-77 to 1993-97) and across several continents. Results Both breast cancer incidence and mortality rates varied 4-fold by geographic location between countries with the highest and lowest rates. Recent (1993-1997) incidence rates ranged from 27/100 000 in Asian countries to 97/100 000 among {US} white women. Overall, North American and northern European countries had the highest incidence rates of breast cancer; intermediate levels were reported in Western Europe, Oceania, Scandinavia, and Israel; and Eastern Europe, South and Latin America, and Asia had the lowest levels. Breast cancer incidence rose 30-40\% from the 1970s to the 1990s in most countries, with the most marked increases among women aged [������]50 years. Mortality from breast cancer paralleled incidence: it was highest in the countries with the highest incidence rates (between 17/100 000 and 27/100 000), lowest in Latin America and Asia (7-14/100 000), and rose most rapidly in countries with the lowest rates. Conclusions Breast cancer incidence and mortality rates remain highest in developed countries compared with developing countries, as a result of differential use of screening mammograms and disparities in lifestyle and hereditary factors. Future studies assessing the combined contributions of both environmental and hereditary factors may provide explanations for worldwide differences in incidence and mortality rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Many uncertainties remain about the free-radical theory of ageing and the role of oxidative damage to {DNA} in cancer. The chemistry and biochemistry of radical-induced {DNA} damage are now well characterized in vitro, but the complexity of in-vivo systems leaves this area still largely unexplored. Measurement of thymine and thymidine glycols in urine may be a means of assaying background levels of radical-induced {DNA} damage in live organisms. Similar approaches may prove useful for testing some of the predictions of the free-radical theory of ageing and of the contribution of free radicals to cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims The relevance of ultrafine particles ({UFPs}, particles {\textless}0.1 ����m diameter), the smallest fraction of ambient particulate matter, on stroke morbidity has not been documented. We studied the effects of short-term changes in exposure to these particles on stroke, separately for ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, mild and severe strokes, and ischaemic strokes with (likely embolic) and without (likely thrombotic) atrial fibrillation ({AF).} Methods and results We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to study the association between short-term exposure to {UFPs}, particulate matter {\textless}10 ����m in diameter ({PM10)}, nitrogen oxides ({NOx)} and carbon monoxide ({CO)} (measured at single background station) and hospital admissions for stroke in Copenhagen (2003������2006). Of 7485 stroke admissions, 6798 were ischaemic and 687 haemorrhagic, 3485 mild, and 2248 severe. Of the ischaemic stroke cases, 1204 had {AF} and 5273 did not. We found significant positive association with exposure to {UFPs}, {NOx} and {CO}, and ischaemic strokes, and {UFPs} and {NOx} and mild strokes, 4 days before admission. The strongest associations were with {UFPs.} Exposure to {UFPs} lead to a 21\% increase in hospital admissions (per interquartile range of 5-day averages; 95\% confidence interval 4������41\%) for mild ischaemic stroke of without {AF} (likely thrombotic origin). Conclusion Our results indicate possible effects of traffic-related air pollution, mainly {UFPs}, on hospital admissions for ischaemic stroke, especially for mild ischaemic stroke of likely thrombotic origin (without {AF).} These are novel findings regarding the relevance of {UFPs} and the heterogeneous effect of air pollution on the severity and origin of stroke, and need confirmation by other data.},

We estimated the mean levels of nitrogen dioxide ({NO(2))} at the residential addresses of the cohort participants since 1971 and modeled the association between {NO(2)} and diabetes incidence with a Cox regression model, separately for two definitions of diabetes: all cases and a more strict definition where unconfirmed cases were excluded. {RESULTS} Over a mean follow-up of 9.7 years of 51,818 eligible subjects, there were 4,040 (7.8\%) incident diabetes cases in total and 2,877 (5.5\%) with confirmed diagnoses. Air pollution was not associated with all diabetes cases (hazard ratio 1.00 [95\% {CI} 0.97-1.04] per interquartile range of 4.9 mug/m(3) mean {NO(2)} levels since 1971), but a borderline statistically significant association was detected with confirmed cases of diabetes (1.04 [1.00-1.08]). Among confirmed diabetes cases, effects were significantly enhanced in nonsmokers (1.12 [1.05-1.20]) and physically active people (1.10 [1.03-1.16]). {CONCLUSIONS} Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution may contribute to the development of diabetes, especially in individuals with a healthy lifestyle, nonsmokers, and physically active individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of pineal indole hormone melatonin on colon carcinogenesis was firstly studied in rats. Two-month-old outbred female {LIO} rats were weekly exposed to 15 (experiment 1, groups 1 and 2) or to five (experiment 2, groups 1 and 2) s.c. injections of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine ({DMH)} at a single dose of 21 mg/kg of body weight. From the day of the first injection of the carcinogen {DMH}, the rats from groups 2 (experiments 1 and 2) were given melatonin five days a week during the night-time (from 18:00 h to 8:00 h), dissolved in tap water at 20 mg/l. The experiment was finalized in 6 months after the first injection of {DMH.} In both experiments the majority of tumors were localized in the descending colon. Tumors of the small intestines developed only in rats from experiment 1. Total incidence of colon tumors as well as tumors in different parts of the colon and the mean number of tumors per rat were much higher in rats from both groups in experiment 1 than that in rats from experiment 2. In experiment 1 melatonin failed to influence the total incidence of colon tumors. However, incidence of carcinomas in the ascending colon was significantly reduced (P {\textless} 0.01). The multiplicity of total colon tumors per rat, as well as the mean number of tumors, ascending and descending colon per rat, was also decreased under the influence of melatonin (group 2 vs group 1, P {\textless} 0.01). In the same experiment, melatonin slightly decreased the depth of tumor invasion and increased number of highly differentiated colon carcinomas induced by {DMH.} The percentage of small tumours in the descending colon among rats from group 2 was higher than that of group 1. Treatment with melatonin was also followed by a decrease in the multiplicity of {DMH-induced} tumors of the duodenum (group 2 vs group 1, P {\textless} 0.05) and by a decrease in the incidence of jejunum and ileum tumors (group 2 vs group 1, P {\textless} 0.05). In experiment 2, the inhibitory effect of melatonin on {DMH-induced} colon carcinogenesis was much more expressed than that in experiment 1. Thus, in group 1 the incidence of total colon tumors, ascending and descending colon tumors, was significantly decreased in comparison with group 2; also melatonin reduced the number of tumors per rat in the ascending and descending colon. The number of colon tumors that invaded only mucosa was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1, P {\textless} 0.05. The ratio of highly differentiated tumors was increased (P {\textless} 0.05) and the ratio of low-differentiated tumors was decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) in rats exposed to melatonin (group 4) as compared with group 3. The number of large size tumors in the ascending and descending colon was decreased whereas the number of small size tumors ({\textless}10 mm2) was increased in those parts of the colon that were under the influence of melatonin in experiment 2. Thus, our results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of melatonin on intestinal carcinogenesis induced by {DMH} in rats.},

Disruption of the circadian rhythms induced by light pollution has been associated with cancer in humans. There are epidemiological evidences of increased breast and colon cancer risk in shift workers. An inhibition of the pineal gland function with exposure to the constant light ({LL)} regimen promoted carcinogenesis whereas the light deprivation inhibits the carcinogenesis. Treatment with pineal indole hormone melatonin inhibits carcinogenesis in pinealectomized rats or animals kept at the standard light/dark regimen ({LD)} or at the {LL} regimen.

  Abstract                 = {The {APHEA} 2 project investigated short-term health effects of particles in eight European cities. In each city associations between particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 microm ({PM(10))} and black smoke and daily counts of emergency hospital admissions for asthma (0-14 and 15-64 yr), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD)}, and all-respiratory disease (65+ yr) controlling for environmental factors and temporal patterns were investigated. Summary {PM(10)} effect estimates (percentage change in mean number of daily admissions per 10 microg/m(3) increase) were asthma (0-14 yr) 1.2\% (95\% {CI:} 0.2, 2.3), asthma (15-64 yr) 1.1\% (0.3, 1.8), and {COPD} plus asthma and all-respiratory (65+ yr) 1.0\% (0.4, 1.5) and 0.9\% (0.6, 1.3). The combined estimates for Black Smoke tended to be smaller and less precisely estimated than for {PM(10).} Variability in the sizes of the {PM(10)} effect estimates between cities was also investigated. In the 65+ groups {PM(10)} estimates were positively associated with annual mean concentrations of ozone in the cities. For asthma admissions (0-14 yr) a number of city-specific factors, including smoking prevalence, explained some of their variability. This study confirms that particle concentrations in European cities are positively associated with increased numbers of admissions for respiratory diseases and that some of the variation in {PM(10)} effect estimates between cities can be explained by city characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary. Background: Consistent evidence has indicated that air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The underlying mechanisms linking air pollutants to increased cardiovascular risk are unclear. Objectives: We investigated the association between the pollution levels and changes in such global coagulation tests as the prothrombin time ({PT)} and the activated partial thromboplastin time ({APTT)} in 1218 normal subjects from the Lombardia Region, Italy. Plasma fibrinogen and naturally occurring anticoagulant proteins were also evaluated. Methods: Hourly concentrations of particulate ({PM10)} and gaseous pollutants ({CO}, {NO2}, {SO2}, and O3) were obtained from 53 monitoring sites covering the study area. Generalized additive models were applied to compute standardized regression coefficients controlled for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, hormone use, temperature, day of the year, and long-term trends. Results: The {PT} became shorter with higher ambient air concentrations at the time of the study of {PM10} (coefficient = ������0.06; P {\textless} 0.05), {CO} (coefficient = ������0.11; P {\textless} 0.001) and {NO2} (coefficient =������0.06; P {\textless} 0.05). In the 30 days before blood sampling, the {PT} was also negatively associated with the average {PM10} (coefficient = ������0.08; P {\textless} 0.05) and {NO2} (coefficient = ������0.08; P {\textless} 0.05). No association was found between the {APTT} and air pollutant levels. In addition, no consistent relations with air pollution were found for fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C and protein S. Conclusions: This investigation shows that air pollution is associated with changes in the global coagulation function, suggesting a tendency towards hypercoagulability after short-term exposure to air pollution. Whether these changes contribute to trigger cardiovascular events remains to be established.},

  Abstract                 = {Background������ Particulate air pollution has been consistently linked to increased risk of arterial cardiovascular disease. Few data on air pollution exposure and risk of venous thrombosis are available. We investigated whether living near major traffic roads increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis ({DVT)}, using distance from roads as a proxy for traffic exposure. Methods and Results������ From 1995 through 2005, we examined 663 patients with {DVT} of the lower limbs and 859 age-matched controls from cities with population {\textgreater}15 000 inhabitants in Lombardia Region, Italy. We assessed distance from residential addresses to the nearest major traffic road using geographic information system methodology. The risk of {DVT} was estimated from logistic regression models adjusting for multiple clinical and environmental covariates. The risk of {DVT} was increased (odds ratio=1.33; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.71; P=0.03 in age-adjusted models; odds ratio=1.47; 95\% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.96; P=0.008 in models adjusted for multiple covariates) for subjects living near a major traffic road (index distance of 3 meters, 10th centile of the distance distribution) compared with those living farther away (reference distance of 245 meters, 90th centile). The increase in {DVT} risk was approximately linear over the observed distance range (from 718 to 0 meters) and was not modified after adjusting for background levels of particulate matter (odds ratio=1.47; 95\% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.96; P=0.008 for 10th versus 90th distance centile in models adjusting for area levels of particulate matter {\textless}10 ����m in aerodynamic diameter in the year before diagnosis). Conclusions������ Living near major traffic roads is associated with increased risk of {DVT.}},

  Abstract                 = {Background���� Particulate air pollution has been linked to heart disease and stroke, possibly resulting from enhanced coagulation and arterial thrombosis. Whether particulate air pollution exposure is related to venous thrombosis is {unknown.Methods}���� We examined the association of exposure to particulate matter of less than 10 ����m in aerodynamic diameter ({PM10)} with deep vein thrombosis ({DVT)} risk in 870 patients and 1210 controls from the Lombardy region in Italy, who were examined between 1995 and 2005. We estimated exposure to {PM10} in the year before {DVT} diagnosis (cases) or examination (controls) through area-specific mean levels obtained from ambient {monitors.Results}���� Higher mean {PM10} level in the year before the examination was associated with shortened prothrombin time ({PT)} in {DVT} cases (standardized regression coefficient [����]����=����������0.12; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, ������0.23 to 0.00) (P����=����.04) and controls (��������=����������0.06; 95\% {CI}, ������0.11 to 0.00) (P����=����.04).

The red blood cells' hemoglobin may be rendered useless for oxygen transport by combination with carbon monoxide or conversion to methemoglobin or sulfhemoglobin. Lead and arsine can damage the erythrocytes' membranes, resulting in anemia. Metabolites of benzene and other volatile polycyclic hydrocarbons are implicated in the causation of leukemias. The extensive use of pesticides and herbicides may be associated with the development of Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and aplastic anemia. The carcinogenic risks from ionizing radiation, especially for leukemia, are well known. More information is needed concerning the epidemiology of environmental factors responsible for damage to blood. Enhanced knowledge about the molecular biology of toxins' effects on the hematopoietic system and improved detection and prevention technologies are needed to answer environmentally related health questions.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Acute exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with acute changes in cardiac outcomes, often within hours of exposure. {OBJECTIVES:} We examined the effects of air pollutants on heart-rate-corrected {QT} interval ({QTc)}, an electrocardiographic marker of ventricular repolarization, and whether these associations were modified by participant characteristics and genetic polymorphisms related to oxidative stress. {METHODS:} We studied repeated measurements of {QTc} on 580 men from the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study ({NAS)} using mixed-effects models with random intercepts. We fitted a quadratic constrained distributed lag model to estimate the cumulative effect on {QTc} of ambient air pollutants including fine particulate matter {\textless}or= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ({PM2.5)}, ozone (O3), black carbon ({BC)}, nitrogen dioxide ({NO2)}, carbon monoxide ({CO)}, and sulfur dioxide ({SO2)} concentrations during the 10 hr before the visit. We genotyped polymorphisms related to oxidative stress and analyzed pollution-susceptibility score interactions using the genetic susceptibility score ({GSS)} method. {RESULTS:} Ambient traffic pollutant concentrations were related to longer {QTc.} An interquartile range ({IQR)} change in {BC} cumulative during the 10 hr before the visit was associated with increased {QTc} [1.89 msec change; 95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, -0.16 to 3.93]. We found a similar association with {QTc} for an {IQR} change in 1-hr {BC} that occurred 4 hr before the visit (2.54 msec change; 95\% {CI}, 0.28-4.80). We found increased {QTc} for {IQR} changes in {NO2} and {CO}, but the change was statistically insignificant. In contrast, we found no association between {QTc} and {PM2.5}, {SO2}, and O3. The association between {QTc} and {BC} was stronger among participants who were obese, who had diabetes, who were nonsmokers, or who had higher {GSSs.} {CONCLUSIONS:} Traffic-related pollutants may increase {QTc} among persons with diabetes, persons who are obese, and nonsmoking elderly individuals; the number of genetic variants related to oxidative stress increases this effect.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE:} Ischemic heart disease ({IHD)} is one of the most common health threats to the adult population of the {U.S.} and other countries. The objective of this study was to examine the association between exposure to elevated annual average levels of Particulate matter 2.5 ({PM2.5)} air quality index ({AQI)} and {IHD} in the general population. {METHODS:} We combined data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the {U.S} Environmental Protection Agency air quality database. We analyzed the data using {SUDAAN} software to adjust the effects of sampling bias, weights, and design effects. {RESULTS:} The prevalence of {IHD} was 9.6\% among respondents who were exposed to an annual average level of {PM2.5} {AQI} {\textgreater} 60 compared with 5.9\% among respondents exposed to an annual average {PM2.5} {AQI} {\textless} or = 60. The respondents with higher levels of {PM2.5} {AQI} exposure were more likely to have {IHD} (adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, 95\% confidence interval 1.11, 2.66) than respondents with lower levels of exposure after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. {CONCLUSIONS:} Our study suggested that exposure to relatively higher levels of average annual {PM2.5} {AQI} may increase the likelihood of {IHD.} In addition to encouraging health-related behavioral changes to reduce {IHD}, efforts should also focus on implementing appropriate measures to reduce exposure to unhealthy {AQI} levels.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of survival models involving a random effect or frailty' term is becoming more common. Usually the random effects are assumed to represent different clusters, and clusters are assumed to be independent. In this paper, we consider random effects corresponding to clusters that are spatially arranged, such as clinical sites or geographical regions. That is, we might suspect that random effects corresponding to strata in closer proximity to each other might also be similar in magnitude. Such spatial arrangement of the strata can be modeled in several ways, but we group these ways into two general settings: geostatistical approaches, where we use the exact geographic locations (e.g. latitude and longitude) of the strata, and lattice approaches, where we use only the positions of the strata relative to each other (e.g. which counties neighbor which others). We compare our approaches in the context of a dataset on infant mortality in Minnesota counties between 1992 and 1996. Our main substantive goal here is to explain the pattern of infant mortality using important covariates (sex, race, birth weight, age of mother, etc.) while accounting for possible (spatially correlated) differences in hazard among the counties. We use the {GIS} {ArcView} to map resulting fitted hazard rates, to help search for possible lingering spatial correlation. The {DIC} criterion (Spiegelhalter et al., Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 2002, to appear) is used to choose among various competing models. We investigate the quality of fit of our chosen model, and compare its results when used to investigate neonatal versus post-neonatal mortality. We also compare use of our time-to-event outcome survival model with the simpler dichotomous outcome logistic model. Finally, we summarize our findings and suggest directions for future research.},

Nocturnal urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin excretion is decreased in primary breast cancer patients compared to age-matched controls and shows negative correlation with tumor-size. J. Pineal Res. 1997; 23:53201358. ������ Munksgaard, Copenhagen In previous studies a tumor-size dependent decline of the circadian amplitude of serum melatonin was found in primary unoperated breast cancer patients, which was not due to changes of the hepatic metabolism of melatonin since its main peripheral metabolite, 6-sulphatoxymelatonin ({aMT6s)}, showed similar serum levels. The aim of the current study was to verify these previous results by measurements of the nocturnal excretion of {aMT6s} in urine. The determination of {aMT6s} was carried out by radioimmunoassay. 17 primary unoperated breast cancer ({BC)} patients and 34 age-matched control patients with different types of benign gynecological diseases awaiting operation (breast diseases, n=13; ovarian diseases, n=12; and uterine diseases, n=9) were analysed. The median nocturnal urinary {aMT6s} excretion (22:0020136:00 hr) was significantly lower (-48\%, P =0.033) in {BC} patients than in controls. Controls showed a significant negative linear regression with age (r = -0.419, P= 0.014). According to multivariate linear regression analysis, {BC} revealed no age-dependency but a significant negative effect of increasing tumor-size on {aMT6s-excretion} (P= 0.036) was detected. These results confirm previous findings of a decreased pineal melatonin secretion in {BC} patients as well as an inverse relationship with tumor-size excluding a possible distortion due to age. The mechanisms involved are unknown but indicate that {BC} may lead to an impaired production of pineal melatonin. The clinical relevance of these findings from therapeutic and diagnostic point of view is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {With temperatures expected to increase because of climate change, it is essential to study the health outcomes of elevated temperature in vulnerable populations, such as expectant mothers. In this study, the authors estimated the association between heat and humidity, as measured by apparent temperature, and preterm delivery. They conducted a case-crossover analysis of almost 60,000 births spanning 16 counties in California that occurred from 1999 to 2006 between May and September. The authors identified cases of preterm birth from a state registry of births, which were combined with meteorologic and air pollution monitoring data based on residential zip code. High ambient temperature was significantly associated with preterm birth for all mothers, regardless of maternal racial/ethnic group, maternal age, maternal education, or sex of the infant. Results indicated that an 8.6\% increase (95\% confidence interval: 6.0, 11.3) in preterm delivery was associated with a {10����F} ({5.6����C)} increase in weekly average (lag06) apparent temperature. Greater associations were observed for younger mothers, blacks, and Asians. These associations were independent of air pollutants. Given the significant associations for apparent temperature and preterm delivery found in this study, more large-scale studies of temperature and preterm delivery are warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Populations susceptible to the effects of particulate matter have begun to be characterized, but the independent contributions of specific factors have not been explored. {METHODS:} We used a case-crossover study to examine {PM10-associated} mortality risk during 1988-1991 among 65,180 elderly residents of Cook County, Illinois, who had a history of hospitalization for heart or lung disease. We assessed how the effect was independently modified by specific diagnoses and personal characteristics. {RESULTS:} We found a 1.14\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} = 0.44\% to 1.85\%) increased risk of death per 10 microg/m3 increase in ambient {PM10} concentration. Persons with heart or lung disease-but no specific diagnosis of myocardial infarction, diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or conduction disorders-were at 0.74\% (-0.29\% to 1.79\%) increased risk. Persons with a history of myocardial infarction had a 2.7-fold higher risk ({CI} = -2.1 to 7.4). Those with diabetes carried a 2.0-fold higher risk ({CI} = -1.5 to 5.5). Risk appeared to decrease with age among elderly men and increase with age among elderly women, but the estimated 3-way interaction was not precise enough to exclude the null. We found no indication that susceptibility varied by group-level socioeconomic measures. {CONCLUSION:} Among a frail population, individuals diagnosed with myocardial infarction or diabetes were at greatest risk of death associated with high concentrations of {PM10.} These results suggest that their susceptibility may derive from prior vascular damage to the heart.},

We investigate whether urban particulate matter ({PM)} air pollution is associated with {CIMT}, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. {METHODS:} We used baseline data (2000 to 2003) from the {HNR} (Heinz Nixdorf Recall) study, a population-based cohort of 4,814 participants, 45 to 75 years of age. We assessed residential long-term exposure to {PM} with a chemistry transport model and measured distance to high traffic. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate associations of air pollutants and traffic with {CIMT}, adjusting for each other, city of residence, age, sex, diabetes, and lifestyle variables. {RESULTS:} Median {CIMT} of the 3,380 analyzed participants was 0.66 mm (interquartile range 0.16 mm). An interdecile range increase in {PM(2.5)} (4.2 mug/m(3)), {PM(10)} (6.7 mug/m(3)), and distance to high traffic (1,939 m) was associated with a 4.3\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]:} 1.9\% to 6.7\%), 1.7\% (95\% {CI:} -0.7\% to 4.1\%), and 1.2\% (95\% {CI:} -0.2\% to 2.6\%) increase in {CIMT}, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS:} Our study shows a clear association of long-term exposure to {PM(2.5)} with atherosclerosis. This finding strengthens the hypothesized role of {PM(2.5)} as a risk factor for atherogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have identified associations between traffic-related air pollution and adverse health effects. Most have used measurements from a few central ambient monitors and/or some measure of traffic as indicators of exposure, disregarding spatial variability and/or factors influencing personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships. This study seeks to utilize publicly available data (i.e., central site monitors, geographic information system ({GIS)}, and property assessment data) and questionnaire responses to predict residential indoor concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants for lower socioeconomic status ({SES)} urban {households.As} part of a prospective birth cohort study in urban Boston, we collected indoor and outdoor 3-4 day samples of nitrogen dioxide ({NO(2))} and fine particulate matter ({PM(2.5))} in 43 low {SES} residences across multiple seasons from 2003 - 2005. Elemental carbon concentrations were determined via reflectance analysis. Multiple traffic indicators were derived using Massachusetts Highway Department data and traffic counts collected outside sampling homes. Home characteristics and occupant behaviors were collected via a standardized questionnaire. Additional housing information was collected through property tax records, and ambient concentrations were collected from a centrally-located ambient {monitor.The} contributions of ambient concentrations, local traffic and indoor sources to indoor concentrations were quantified with regression analyses. {PM(2.5)} was influenced less by local traffic but had significant indoor sources, while {EC} was associated with traffic and {NO(2)} with both traffic and indoor sources. Comparing models based on covariate selection using p-values or a Bayesian approach yielded similar results, with traffic density within a 50m buffer of a home and distance from a truck route as important contributors to indoor levels of {NO(2)} and {EC}, respectively. The Bayesian approach also highlighted the uncertanity in the models. We conclude that by utilizing public databases and focused questionnaire data we can identify important predictors of indoor concentrations for multiple air pollutants in a high-risk population.},

  Abstract                 = {Rationale: There are unexplained geographical and seasonal differences in the short-term effects of fine particulate matter ({PM2.5)} on human health. The hypothesis has been advanced to include the possibility that such differences might be due to variations in the {PM2.5} chemical composition, but evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. Objectives: To examine whether variation in the relative risks ({RR)} of hospitalization associated with ambient exposure to {PM2.5} total mass reflects differences in {PM2.5} chemical composition. Methods: We linked two national datasets by county and by season: (1) long-term average concentrations of {PM2.5} chemical components for 2000������2005 and (2) {RRs} of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations for persons 65 years or older associated with a 10-����g/m3 increase in {PM2.5} total mass on the same day for 106 {U.S.} counties for 1999 through 2005. Measurements and Main Results: We found a positive and statistically significant association between county-specific estimates of the short-term effects of {PM2.5} on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations and county-specific levels of vanadium, elemental carbon, or nickel {PM2.5} content. Conclusions: Communities with higher {PM2.5} content of nickel, vanadium, and elemental carbon and/or their related sources were found to have higher risk of hospitalizations associated with short-term exposure to {PM2.5.}},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND} Little is known about the short-term effects of ultrafine particles. {METHODS} We evaluated the effect of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter {\textless}or=10 microm ({PM10)}, {\textless}or=2.5 microm ({PM2.5)}, and ultrafine particles on emergency hospital admissions in Rome 2001-2005. We studied residents aged {\textgreater}or=35 years hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, lower respiratory tract infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD).} Information was available for factors indicating vulnerability, such as age and previous admissions for {COPD.} Particulate matter data were collected daily at one central fixed monitor. A case-crossover analysis was performed using a time-stratified approach. We estimated percent increases in risk per 14 microg/m {PM10}, per 10 microg/m {PM2.5}, and per 9392 {particles/mL.} {RESULTS} An immediate impact (lag 0) of {PM2.5} on hospitalizations for acute coronary syndrome (2.3\% [95\% confidence interval = 0.5\% to 4.2\%]) and heart failure (2.4\% [0.3\% to 4.5\%]) was found, whereas the effect on lower respiratory tract infections (2.8\% [0.5\% to 5.2\%]) was delayed (lag 2). Particle number concentration showed an association only with admissions for heart failure (lag 0-5; 2.4\% [0.2\% to 4.7\%]) and {COPD} (lag 0; 1.6\% [0.0\% to 3.2\%]). The effects were generally stronger in the elderly and during winter. There was no clear effect modification with previous {COPD.} {CONCLUSIONS} We found sizeable acute health effects of fine and ultrafine particles. Although differential reliability in exposure assessment, in particular of ultrafine particles, precludes a firm conclusion, the study indicates that particulate matter of different sizes tends to have diverse outcomes, with dissimilar latency between exposure and health response.},

  Abstract                 = {Air surface temperature (Tair) is an important parameter for a wide range of applications such as vector-borne disease bionomics, hydrology and climate change studies. Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of Tair at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (Tmax), minimum (Tmin) and average air temperature (Tavg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2������3 {����C} range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1������2 {����C.} The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate Tmax, Tmin and Tavg for a 10 year period based on remote {sensing������Land} Surface Temperature ({LST)} data obtained from {MODIS������and} auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a {MEF} (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a {RMSE} of 1.33 {����C.} Regarding Tmax and Tmin, the best {MEF} achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74 {����C} {RMSE.} The developed datasets provided weekly 1 km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of Tair. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate Tair estimations at a larger scale in the future.},

Indeed, often the primary motivation for the analysis is to identify unknown geographically varying risk factors. An exploratory approach to mapping the spatial relative risk is to scale the risk map using the background risk in the unexposed (or less-exposed) population. Exposure to unknown spatial risk factors is defined via specific cluster analysis. Identification of spatial disease clusters separates the population into those inside and those outside high risk areas (the exposed and unexposed populations). This exploratory approach to relative risk mapping gives the investigator an impression about the importance and geographical distribution of the unknown spatial risk factors. Two examples illustrate the exploratory relative risk mapping approach using a spatial point data set on pseudorabies in pig-herds and a regional count data set on small fox tapeworm infections in red foxes.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel photoreceptor of the mammalian retina has recently been discovered and characterized. The novel cells differ radically from the classical rod and cone photoreceptors. They use a unique photopigment, most probably melanopsin. They have lower sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution than rods or cones and they seem specialized to encode ambient light intensity. Most surprisingly, they are ganglion cells and, thus, communicate directly with the brain. These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells ({ipRGCs)} help to synchronize circadian rhythms with the solar day. They also contribute to the pupillary light reflex and other behavioral and physiological responses to environmental illumination.},

  Abstract                 = {The immune system is well characterized for its critical role in host defense. Far beyond this limited role however, there is mounting evidence for the vital role the immune system plays within the brain, in both normal, ������homeostatic������ processes (e.g., sleep, metabolism, memory), as well as in pathology, when the dysregulation of immune molecules may occur. This recognition is especially critical in the area of brain development. Microglia and astrocytes, the primary immunocompetent cells of the {CNS}, are involved in every major aspect of brain development and function, including synaptogenesis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor ({TNF)����}, interleukin [{IL]-1����}, and {IL-6} are produced by glia within the {CNS}, and are implicated in synaptic formation and scaling, long-term potentiation, and neurogenesis. Importantly, cytokines are involved in both injury and repair, and the conditions underlying these distinct outcomes are under intense investigation and debate. Evidence from both animal and human studies implicates the immune system in a number of disorders with known or suspected developmental origins, including schizophrenia, anxiety/depression, and cognitive dysfunction. We review the evidence that infection during the perinatal period of life acts as a vulnerability factor for later-life alterations in cytokine production, and marked changes in cognitive and affective behaviors throughout the remainder of the lifespan. We also discuss the hypothesis that long-term changes in brain glial cell function underlie this vulnerability.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND} Previous studies suggest that air pollution is related to thrombosis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Mechanisms and sources of susceptibility are still unclear. One possibility is that these associations can be modified by {DNA} methylation states. {METHODS} We conducted a cohort study with repeated measurements of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ({ICAM-1)}, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ({VCAM-1)} in 704 elderly men participating in the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study (2000-2009). We investigated short- and intermediate-term air pollution effects on these blood markers, and epigene-environment interactions by {DNA} methylation of Alu, {LINE-1}, tissue factor (F3), Toll-like receptor 2 ({TLR-2)}, and {ICAM-1.} {RESULTS} We found effects of particle number, black carbon, nitrogen dioxide ({NO(2))}, and carbon monoxide ({CO)} on fibrinogen. Ozone was a predictor of C-reactive protein and {ICAM-1.} Particle number, black carbon, {NO(2)}, {CO}, {PM(2.5)}, and sulfates were associated with {ICAM-1} and {VCAM-1.} An interquartile range increase in 24-hour exposure for {NO(2)} was associated with a 1.7\% (95\% confidence interval = 0.2\%-3.3\%) increase in fibrinogen for ozone; a 10.8\% (2.2\%-20.0\%) increase in C-reactive protein for particle number; a 5.9\% (3.6\%-8.3\%) increase in {ICAM-1;} and for {PM(2.5)}, a 3.7\% (1.7\%-5.8\%) increase in {VCAM-1.} The air pollution effect was stronger among subjects having higher Alu, lower {LINE-1}, tissue factor, or {TLR-2} methylation status. {CONCLUSION} We observed associations of traffic-related pollutants on fibrinogen, and both traffic and secondary particles on C-reactive protein, {ICAM-1}, and {VCAM-1.} There was effect modification by {DNA} methylation status, indicating that epigenetic states can convey susceptibility to air pollution.},

Population studies support the hypothesis that exposure to light at night may represent a new risk factor for breast cancer possibly through the suppression of pineal {MLT} production and/or circadian disruption. We tested the ability of constant light exposure to suppress {MLT} production in female nude rats and stimulate the growth of tissue-isolated {MCF-7} human breast cancer xenografts via increased tumor linoleic acid ({LA)} metabolism. Rats maintained on an alternating light/dark cycle ({L:D} group) exhibited a robust circadian {MLT} rhythm that was abolished following constant light exposure. During the exposure of animals bearing tissue-isolated human {MCF-7} breast cancer xenografts to constant light, the rate of tumor growth markedly increased relative to the {L:D} group. Tumor {LA} uptake and its metabolism to the mitogen 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-{HODE)} were also substantially higher under constant light conditions. This is the first biological evidence for a potential link between constant light exposure and increased human breast oncogenesis involving {MLT} suppression and stimulation of tumor {LA} metabolism.},

  Abstract                 = {The increased breast cancer risk in female night shift workers has been postulated to result from the suppression of pineal melatonin production by exposure to light at night. Exposure of rats bearing rat hepatomas or human breast cancer xenografts to increasing intensities of white fluorescent light during each 12-hour dark phase (0-345 \{micro\}W/cm2) resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of nocturnal melatonin blood levels and a stimulation of tumor growth and linoleic acid uptake/metabolism to the mitogenic molecule 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid. Venous blood samples were collected from healthy, premenopausal female volunteers during either the daytime, nighttime, or nighttime following 90 minutes of ocular bright, white fluorescent light exposure at 580 \{micro\}W/cm2 (i.e., 2,800 lx). Compared with tumors perfused with daytime-collected melatonin-deficient blood, human breast cancer xenografts and rat hepatomas perfused in situ, with nocturnal, physiologically melatonin-rich blood collected during the night, exhibited markedly suppressed proliferative activity and linoleic acid uptake/metabolism. Tumors perfused with melatonin-deficient blood collected following ocular exposure to light at night exhibited the daytime pattern of high tumor proliferative activity. These results are the first to show that the tumor growth response to exposure to light during darkness is intensity dependent and that the human nocturnal, circadian melatonin signal not only inhibits human breast cancer growth but that this effect is extinguished by short-term ocular exposure to bright, white light at night. These mechanistic studies are the first to provide a rational biological explanation for the increased breast cancer risk in female night shift workers.},

The incidence of primary liver cancer is increasing in several developed countries, including the United States, and the increase will likely continue for some decades. The trend is a result of a cohort effect related to infection with hepatitis B and C viruses, the incidence of which peaked in the 1950s to 1980s. In selected areas of some developing countries, the incidence of primary liver cancer has decreased, possibly as a result of the introduction of hepatitis B virus vaccine. The geographic variability in incidence of primary liver cancer is largely explained by the distribution and the natural history of the hepatitis B and C viruses. The attributable risk estimates for the combined effects of these infections account for well over 80\% of liver cancer cases worldwide. Primary liver cancer is the first human cancer largely amenable to prevention using hepatitis B virus vaccines and screening of blood and blood products for hepatitis B and C viruses.

  Abstract                 = {Background: There are no recent estimates of the incidence and mortality from cancer at a European level. Those data that are available generally refer to the mid-1990s and are of limited use for cancer control planning. We present estimates of the cancer burden in Europe in 2004, including data for the (25 Member States) European {Union.Methods:} The most recent sources of incidence and mortality data available in the Descriptive Epidemiology Group at {IARC} were applied to population projections to derive the best estimates of the burden of cancer, in terms of incidence and mortality, for Europe in {2004.Results:} In 2004 in Europe, there were an estimated 2 886 800 incident cases of cancer diagnosed and 1 711 000 cancer deaths. The most common incident form of cancer was lung cancer (13.3\% of all incident cases), followed by colorectal cancer (13.2\%) and breast cancer (13\%). Lung cancer was also the most common cause of cancer death (341 800 deaths), followed by colorectal (203 700), stomach (137 900) and breast (129 {900).Conclusions:} With an estimated 2.9 million new cases (54\% occurring in men, 46\% in women) and 1.7 million deaths (56\% in men, 44\% in women) each year, cancer remains an important public health problem in Europe, and the ageing of the European population will cause these numbers to continue to increase even if age-specific rates remain constant. To make great progress quickly against cancer in Europe, the need is evident to make a concerted attack on the big killers: lung, colorectal, breast and stomach cancer. Stomach cancer rates are falling everywhere in Europe and public health measures are available to reduce the incidence and mortality of lung cancer, colorectal cancer and breast cancer.},

However, there is considerable controversy as to whether these differences in diagnosis and survival are attributable to race or socioeconomic status. Our goal was to disentangle the influence of race and socioeconomic status on breast cancer stage, treatment, and survival. Methods: We linked data from the Metropolitan Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER)1} registry to Michigan Medicaid enrollment files and identified 5719 women diagnosed with breast cancer, of whom 593 were insured by Medicaid. We first calculated the unadjusted odds ratios ({ORs)} associated with race, Medicaid insurance, and poverty for breast cancer stage at diagnosis, breast cancer treatment, and death. We then estimated the {ORs} of having late-stage breast cancer at diagnosis, breast-conserving surgery, no surgery, and death using logistic regression after controlling for clinical and nonclinical factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Before controlling for Medicaid enrollment and poverty, African-American women had a higher likelihood than white women of each unfavorable breast cancer outcome. However, after controlling for covariates, African-American women were not statistically significantly different from white women on most outcomes except for surgical choice. African-American women were more likely than white women to have no surgery (adjusted {OR} = 1.62; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} = 1.11 to 2.37). Among women who had surgery, African-American women were more likely to have breast-conserving surgery than were white women (adjusted {OR} = 1.63; 95\% {CI} = 1.33 to 1.98). Conclusions: The linkage of Medicaid and {SEER} data provides more in-depth information on low-income women than has been available in past studies. In our Metropolitan Detroit study population, race was not statistically significantly associated with unfavorable breast cancer outcomes. However, low socioeconomic status was associated with late-stage breast cancer at diagnosis, type of treatment received, and death.},

  Abstract                 = {The photopigment in the human eye that transduces light for circadian and neuroendocrine regulation, is unknown. The aim of this study was to establish an action spectrum for light-induced melatonin suppression that could help elucidate the ocular photoreceptor system for regulating the human pineal gland. Subjects (37 females, 35 males, mean age of 24.5 \{+/-\} 0.3 years) were healthy and had normal color vision. Full-field, monochromatic light exposures took place between 2:00 and 3:30 {A.M.} while subjects' pupils were dilated. Blood samples collected before and after light exposures were quantified for melatonin. Each subject was tested with at least seven different irradiances of one wavelength with a minimum of 1 week between each nighttime exposure. Nighttime melatonin suppression tests (n = 627) were completed with wavelengths from 420 to 600 nm. The data were fit to eight univariant, sigmoidal fluence-response curves (R2 = 0.81-0.95). The action spectrum constructed from these data fit an opsin template (R2 = 0.91), which identifies 446-477 nm as the most potent wavelength region providing circadian input for regulating melatonin secretion. The results suggest that, in humans, a single photopigment may be primarily responsible for melatonin suppression, and its peak absorbance appears to be distinct from that of rod and cone cell photopigments for vision. The data also suggest that this new photopigment is retinaldehyde based. These findings suggest that there is a novel opsin photopigment in the human eye that mediates circadian photoreception.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE:} Air pollution is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Many of the biological pathways involved could also promote diabetes mellitus ({DM).} We therefore investigated the association between {DM} prevalence and exposure to traffic-related air pollution (nitrogen dioxide [{NO} 2]). {METHODS:} Study participants were patients who attended two respiratory clinics in Hamilton (n = 5228) and Toronto (n = 2406). The diagnosis of {DM} was ascertained by linkage to administrative databases of the Ontario universal Health Insurance Plan for patients aged 40 years and above. Geographic Information systems methodology was used to assign individual estimates of {NO2} based on a network of samplers in each city. Logistic regression was used to estimate the relations between {NO2} exposures and the odds of {DM} diagnosis. {RESULTS:} After adjusting for age, body mass index, and neighborhood income there were positive effects in women on the odds ratio for {DM} for each 1 ppb {NO2} exposure in Toronto ({OR} 1.055, 95\% {CI:} 0.99 to 1.11) and Hamilton ({OR} 1.029, 95\% {CI:} 0.98 to 1.08). In a meta-analytic model including both cities, there was a significant effect in women ({OR} = 1.04; 95\% {CI:} 1.00 to 1.08). Across the inter-quartile range (approximately 4 ppb {NO2)} there was nearly a 17\% increase in the odds of {DM} for women. There were no positive associations among men. {CONCLUSIONS:} Exposure to {NO2}, a marker of traffic-related air pollutants, was associated with {DM} prevalence among women. Exposure estimate errors in men may explain the apparent gender difference. These results suggest that common air pollutants are associated with {DM} and warrant more investigation to determine if this is a cause-and-effect relationship.},

Interventions that generate alternative 24������h light/dark patterns that facilitate appropriate circadian phase shifting are discussed. Such interventions include minimizing night workers' exposure to the external light/dark cycle, and the use of intermittent and moving patterns of bright light at work. The efficacy of melatonin in phase shifting circadian rhythms in the field is also addressed and compared to that of bright light. We present sleep/light exposure schedules that could produce circadian adaptation in permanent night workers.

  Abstract                 = {There is a growing concern that short-term exposure to combustion-related air pollution is associated with increased risk of death. This finding is based largely on time-series studies that estimate associations between daily variations in ambient air pollution concentrations and in the number of nonaccidental deaths within a community. Because these results are not based on cohort or dynamic population designs, where individuals are followed in time, it has been suggested that estimates of effect from these time-series studies cannot be used to determine the amount of life lost because of short-term exposures. We show that results from time-series studies are equivalent to estimates obtained from a dynamic population when each individual's survival experience can be summarized as the daily number of deaths. This occurs when the following conditions are satisfied: a) the environmental covariates vary in time and not between individuals; b) on any given day, the probability of death is small; c) on any given day and after adjusting for known risk factors for mortality such age, sex, smoking habits, and environmental exposures, each subject of the at-risk population has the same probability of death; d) environmental covariates have a common effect on mortality of all members of at-risk population; and e) the averages of individual risk factors, such as smoking habits, over the at-risk population vary smoothly with time. Under these conditions, the association between temporal variation in the environmental covariates and the survival experience of members of the dynamic population can be estimated by regressing the daily number of deaths on the daily value of the environmental covariates, as is done in time-series mortality studies. Issues in extrapolating risk estimates based on time-series studies in one population to estimate the amount of life lost in another population are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The chronic health effects associated with sustained exposures to high concentrations of air pollutants are an important issue for millions of megacity residents and millions more living in smaller urban and rural areas. Particulate matter (PM) and ozone (O3) concentrations close or above their respective air quality standards during the last 20 years affect 24 million people living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). Herein we discuss PM and O3 trends in MCMA and their possible association with the observed central nervous system (CNS) effects in clinically healthy children. We argue that prenatal and postnatal sustained exposures to a natural environmental exposure chamber contribute to detrimental neural responses. The emerging picture for MCMA children shows systemic inflammation, immunodysregulation at both systemic and brain levels, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, small blood vessel pathology, and an intrathecal inflammatory process, along with the early neuropathological hallmarks for Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. Exposed brains are briskly responding to their harmful environment and setting the bases for structural and volumetric changes, cognitive, olfactory, auditory and vestibular deficits and long term neurodegenerative consequences. We need to improve our understanding of the PM pediatric short and long term CNS impact through multidisciplinary research. Public health benefit can be achieved by integrating interventions that reduce fine PM levels and pediatric exposures and establishing preventative screening programs targeting pediatric populations that are most at risk. We fully expect that the health of 24 million residents is important and blocking pediatric air pollution research and hiding critical information that ought to be available to our population, health, education and social workers is not in the best interest of our children.},

Monthly concentrations of ambient air pollutants were obtained from monitoring stations [{PM} {\textless} 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter ({PM10)}, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide] or airport visibility data [{PM} {\textless} 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ({PM2.5)]} and interpolated to {ZIP} code centroids of work and residence locations. All participants had completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire at baseline (1976), and follow-up information on environmental tobacco smoke and other personal sources of air pollution were available from four subsequent questionnaires from 1977 through 2000. Persons with prevalent {CHD}, stroke, or diabetes at baseline (1976) were excluded, and analyses were controlled for a number of potential confounders, including lifestyle. In females, the relative risk ({RR)} for fatal {CHD} with each 10-microg/m3 increase in {PM2.5} was 1.42 [95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 1.06-1.90] in the single-pollutant model and 2.00 (95\% {CI}, 1.51-2.64) in the two-pollutant model with O3. Corresponding {RRs} for a 10-microg/m3 increase in {PM(10-2.5)} and {PM10} were 1.62 and 1.45, respectively, in all females and 1.85 and 1.52 in postmenopausal females. No associations were found in males. A positive association with fatal {CHD} was found with all three {PM} fractions in females but not in males. The risk estimates were strengthened when adjusting for gaseous pollutants, especially O3, and were highest for {PM2.5.} These findings could have great implications for policy regulations.},

Individuals with diabetes or heart disease, or who had smoked in the preceding month were excluded. {HRV} was measured in all subjects during rest, paced breathing and active standing (Ewing manoeuvre). {HRV} was analysed in time and frequency domains and compared between the four exposure zones. {RESULTS:} There were no significant differences between exposure zones in {HRV}, in either time or frequency domains, even after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity and body mass index. There was no significant {HRV} change in three individuals in whom {HRV} was measured before and during an exposure to combined {SO(2)} 100-250 ppb and concentration of respirable particles of diameter {\textgreater}/=2.5 mu ({PM(2.5))} {\textgreater}500 mug/m(3). Age was significantly correlated with time-domain parameters during paced breathing and the Ewing manoeuvre. {CONCLUSIONS:} This study of healthy individuals found no appreciable effects of vog on the autonomic nervous system.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} The association of particulate matter ({PM)} with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well documented. {PM-induced} ischemia is considered a potential mechanism linking {PM} to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS:} In a repeated-measures study including 5979 observations on 48 patients 43 to 75 years of age, we investigated associations of ambient pollution with {ST-segment} level changes averaged over half-hour periods measured in the modified V(5) position by 24-hour Holter {ECG} monitoring. Each patient was observed up to 4 times within 1 year after a percutaneous intervention for myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without infarction, or stable coronary artery disease without acute coronary syndrome. Elevation in fine particles ({PM(2.5))} and black carbon levels predicted depression of half-hour-averaged {ST-segment} levels. An interquartile increase in the previous 24-hour mean black carbon level was associated with a 1.50-fold increased risk of {ST-segment} depression {\textgreater} or =0.1 mm (95\% {CI}, 1.19 to 1.89) and a -0.031-mm (95\% {CI}, -0.042 to -0.019) decrease in half-hour-averaged {ST-segment} level (continuous outcome). Effects were greatest within the first month after hospitalization and for patients with myocardial infarction during hospitalization or with diabetes. {CONCLUSIONS:} {ST-segment} depression is associated with increased exposure to {PM(2.5)} and black carbon in cardiac patients. The risk of pollution-associated {ST-segment} depression may be greatest in those with myocardial injury in the first month after the cardiac event.},

  Abstract                 = {Although ground-level {PM2.5} monitoring sites provide accurate measurements, their spatial coverage within a given region is limited and thus often insufficient for exposure and epidemiological studies. Satellite data expand spatial coverage, enhancing our ability to estimate location- and/or subject-specific exposures to {PM2.5.} Recently, a new Multi- Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction ({MAIAC)} algorithm was developed for {MODIS} which provides {AOD} at 1 km resolution. Using {MAIAC} data, the relationship between {MAIAC} {AOD} and {PM2.5} as measured by the 27 {EPA} ground monitoring stations was investigated. These results were also compared to conventional {MODIS} 10 km {AOD} retrieval ({MOD04)} for the same days and locations. The coefficients of determination for {MOD04} and for {MAIAC} are R2=0.45 and 0.50, respectively, suggesting that {AOD} is a reasonably good proxy for {PM2.5} ground concentrations. Finally, we studied the relationship between {PM2.5} and {AOD} at the intra-urban scale (������10km) in Boston. The fine resolution results indicated spatial variability in particle concentration at a sub-10 kilometer scale.},

Comparing the Atlas with the United States Department of Energy ({DOE)} population density data base, we determined the fraction of population who are living under a sky of given brightness. About two-thirds of the World population and 99 per cent of the population in the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) and European Union live in areas where the night sky is above the threshold set for polluted status. Assuming average eye functionality, about one-fifth of the World population, more than two-thirds of the United States population and more than one half of the European Union population have already lost naked eye visibility of the Milky Way. Finally, about one-tenth of the World population, more than 40 per cent of the United States population and one sixth of the European Union population no longer view the heavens with the eye adapted to night vision, because of the sky brightness.},

In this study, the results of the Italian {EpiAir} Project are reported on the effect of air pollution on hospital admissions in 9 Italian cities during 2001-2005. The association between particulate matter ({PM10)} and gases ({NO2} and O3) and hospital admissions for cardiac, cerebrovascular, respiratory conditions, pulmonary embolism and diabetes has been evaluated. {MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} The study population consists of 701,902 hospital admissions of subjects residents in nine Italian cities and hospitalized in the city in the period 2001- 2005. We used a case-crossover approach and the statistical analysis considered the relevant temporal and meteorological factors for confounding adjustment. The results for ozone refer to the warm semester. The analysis of the association between air pollution and admissions was conducted for each city, and the city-specific estimates were meta-analyzed to obtain pooled results. {RESULTS:} we found an immediate effect of {PM10} and {NO2} (lag 0) for cardiac diseases as a group and for specific conditions (coronary syndrome and heart failure). No effect of ozone was observed. For cerebrovascular diseases we did not observe a positive effect of the three pollutants. An effect of {NO2} on pulmonary embolism was detected. The association between air pollutants and hospitalization for respiratory diseases (respiratory infections, {COPD} and asthma) showed different lags for the three pollutants: the effect of {PM10} was immediate at lag 0-1 while the effects of {NO2} and ozone were prolonged at lag 0-5. The strongest association was between {NO2} and asthma admissions, especially in children. No effects on diabetes were found. {CONCLUSIONS:} the main results of the present study confirm the deleterious short term impact of air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity in Italian cities.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Evidence suggests that longer-term exposure to air pollutants over years confers higher risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than shorter term exposure. One explanation is that cumulative adverse effects that develop over longer durations lead to the genesis of chronic disease. Preliminary epidemiological and clinical evidence suggest that air pollution may contribute to the development hypertension and type 2 diabetes. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS:} We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess incidence rate ratios ({IRRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI)} for incident hypertension and diabetes associated with exposure to fine particulate matter ({PM(2.5))} and nitrogen oxides ({NOx)} in a cohort of African American women living in Los Angeles. Pollutant levels were estimated at participant residential addresses with land use regression models ({NOx)} and interpolation from monitoring station measurements ({PM(2.5)).} Over follow-up from 1995-2005, 531 incident cases of hypertension and 183 incident cases of diabetes occurred. When pollutants were analyzed separately, the {IRR} for hypertension for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in {PM(2.5)} was 1.48 (95\% {CI} 0.95-2.31) and the {IRR} for the interquartile range (12.4 parts per billion) of {NOx} was 1.14 (95\% {CI} 1.03-1.25). The corresponding {IRRs} for diabetes were 1.63 (95\% {CI} 0.78-3.44) and 1.25 (95\% {CI} 1.07-1.46). When both pollutants were included in the same model, the {IRRs} for {PM(2.5)} were attenuated and the {IRRs} for {NOx} were essentially unchanged for both outcomes. {CONCLUSIONS:} Our results suggest that exposure to air pollutants, especially traffic-related pollutants, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and possibly of hypertension.},

  Abstract                 = {Fine particulate matter measurements ({PM2.5)} are essential for air quality monitoring and related public health; however, the shortage of reliable measurmennts constrains researchers to use other means for obtaining reliable estimates over large scales. In particular, model forecasters and satellite community use their respective products to develop ground particulate matter estimations but few experiments have explored how the remote sensing approaches compare to the high resolution models. . In this paper we focus on studying the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites ({GOES)} regression based estimates in comparison to more direct bias corrected outputs from the Community Multiscale Air Quality ({CMAQ)} model, We use a two-year dataset (2005-2006) and apply urban, season and hour filters to illustrate the agreement between estimated and in-situ measured fine particulate matter from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ({NYSDEC).} We first begin by analyzing the correspondence between ground aerosol optical depth ({AOD)} measurements from an {AERONET} ({AErosol} {RObotic} {NETwork)} Cimel sun/sky radiometer with both satellite and model products in one urban location; we show that satellite readings perform better than model outputs, especially during the summer ({RMODIS{\textgreater}=0.65}, {RCMAQ{\textgreater}=0.37).} This is a clear symptom of the difficulty in the models to properly model realistic optical properties. We then turn to a direct assessment of {PM2.5} presenting individual comparisons between ground {PM2.5} measurements with satellite/model predictions and demonstrate the higher accuracy from model estimations ({RurbanMODIS} ������ 0.74, {RurbanCMAQ} ������ 0.77; Rnon-{urbanMODIS} ������ 0.48, Rnon-{urbanCMAQ} ������ 0.78). In general, we find that the bias corrected {CMAQ} estimates are superior to satellite based estimators except at very high resolution. Finally, we show that when using both model and satellite approximations as separate estimators merged optimally, our product ({PM2.5} average) becomes closer to real measurements with improved correlations ({RAVE} {\textasciitilde} 0.86) in urban areas during the summer.},

We identified deaths occurring between 1991 and 2001 through record linkage. We calculated hazard ratios ({HRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)} adjusted for available individual-level and contextual covariates using both standard Cox proportional survival models and nested, spatial random-effects survival models., Results: Using standard Cox models, we calculated {HRs} of 1.15 (95\% {CI:} 1.13, 1.16) from nonaccidental causes and 1.31 (95\% {CI:} 1.27, 1.35) from ischemic heart disease for each 10-����g/m3 increase in concentrations of {PM2.5.} Using spatial random-effects models controlling for the same variables, we calculated {HRs} of 1.10 (95\% {CI:} 1.05, 1.15) and 1.30 (95\% {CI:} 1.18, 1.43), respectively. We found similar associations between nonaccidental mortality and {PM2.5} based on satellite-derived estimates and ground-based measurements in a subanalysis of subjects in 11 cities., Conclusions: In this large national cohort of nonimmigrant Canadians, mortality was associated with long-term exposure to {PM2.5.} Associations were observed with exposures to {PM2.5} at concentrations that were predominantly lower (mean, 8.7 ����g/m3; interquartile range, 6.2 ����g/m3) than those reported previously.},

This issue, pp {662������8.Summary.} Background: Ambient air pollution is a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, possibly because of alterations in coagulation that influence the arterial circulation. Whether air pollution influences diseases associated with peripheral venous thrombogenesis remains largely unknown. Objectives: To determine the association between air pollution and venous thromboembolic disease ({VTE)} in a sample of the general population. Methods: A time-series analysis was used to test the association between daily air pollution and {VTE} hospitalizations in Santiago between 2001 and 2005. Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day of the week and average daily humidex. Results: From a population of 5.4 million, there were, on average, 2.3 admissions for {VTE} per day. Pooled estimates of relative risk ({RR)} [95\% confidence interval ({CI)]} of hospitalization for venous disease were: 1.07 (1.05, 1.09) for a 58.4 p.p.b. increase in ozone (O3); 1.06 (1.02, 1.09) for a 5.85 p.p.b. increase in sulphur dioxide ({SO2);} 1.08 (1.03, 1.12) for a 29.25 ����g/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide ({NO2);} and 1.05 (1.03, 1.06) for a 20.02 ����g/m3 increase in particulate matter ������ 2.5 ����m in mean aerodynamic diameter ({PM2.5).} For pulmonary embolism ({PE)} results were: 1.10 (1.07, 1.13) for O3; 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) for {SO2;} 1.07 (1.04, 1.09) for {NO2;} and 1.05(1.03, 1.06) for {PM2.5}, respectively. Conclusion: Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis and {PE}, a disease with a significant fatality rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Exposure to light at night may increase the risk of breast cancer by suppressing the normal nocturnal production of melatonin by the pineal gland, which, in turn, could increase the release of estrogen by the ovaries. This study investigated whether such exposure is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women. Methods: Case patients (n = 813), aged 20-74 years, were diagnosed from November 1992 through March 1995; control subjects (n = 793) were identified by random-digit dialing and were frequency matched according to 5-year age groups. An in-person interview was used to gather information on sleep habits and bedroom lighting environment in the 10 years before diagnosis and lifetime occupational history. Odds ratios ({ORs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)} were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for other potential risk factors. Results: Breast cancer risk was increased among subjects who frequently did not sleep during the period of the night when melatonin levels are typically at their highest ({OR} = 1.14 for each night per week; 95\% {CI} = 1.01 to 1.28). Risk did not increase with interrupted sleep accompanied by turning on a light. There was an indication of increased risk among subjects with the brightest bedrooms. Graveyard shiftwork was associated with increased breast cancer risk ({OR} = 1.6; 95\% {CI} = 1.0 to 2.5), with a trend of increased risk with increasing years and with more hours per week of graveyard shiftwork (P = .02, Wald chi-squared test). Conclusion: The results of this study provide evidence that indicators of exposure to light at night may be associated with the risk of developing breast cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract There is increasing interest in the possibility that disruption of normal circadian rhythm may increase the risk of developing cancer. Persons who engage in nightshift work may exhibit altered nighttime melatonin levels and reproductive hormone profiles that could increase the risk of hormone-related diseases, including breast cancer. Epidemiologic studies are now beginning to emerge suggesting that women who work at night, and who experience sleep deprivation, circadian disruption, and exposure to light-at-night are at an increased risk of breast cancer, and possibly colorectal cancer as well. Several studies have been conducted in Seattle recently to investigate the effects of factors that can disrupt circadian rhythm and alter normal nocturnal production of melatonin and reproductive hormones of relevance to breast cancer etiology. Studies completed to date have found: (1) an increased risk of breast cancer associated with indicators of exposure to light-at-night and night shift work; and (2) decreased nocturnal urinary levels of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin associated with exposure to 60-Hz magnetic fields in the bedroom the same night, and a number of other factors including hours of daylight, season, alcohol consumption and body mass index. Recently completed is an experimental crossover study designed to investigate whether exposure to a 60-Hz magnetic field under controlled conditions in the home sleeping environment is associated with a decrease in nocturnal urinary concentration of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin, and an increase in the urinary concentration of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and estradiol in a sample of healthy women of reproductive age. Presently underway is a study to determine whether working at night is associated with decreased levels of urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin, and increased urinary concentrations of the reproductive hormones listed above in a sample of healthy women of reproductive age, and to elucidate characteristics of sleep among night shift workers that are related to the hormone patterns identified. A proposal is under review to extend these studies to a sample of healthy men to investigate whether working at night is associated with decreased levels of urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin, and increased concentrations of urinary cortisol and cortisone, urinary levels of a number of androgen metabolites, and serum concentrations of a number of reproductive hormones. Secondarily, the proposed study will elucidate characteristics of sleep among night shift workers that are related to the hormone patterns identified, as well as investigate whether polymorphisms of the genes thought to regulate the human circadian clock are associated with the ability to adapt to night shift work. It is anticipated that collectively these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of circadian disruption in the etiology of cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {MCMA-2003 was a major field campaign in- vestigating the atmospheric chemistry of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) in April of 2003. This paper describes the wind circulation patterns during the campaign both within the Mexico City basin and on the regional scale. “Time roses” are introduced to concisely analyze the diurnal wind patterns. Three episode types were identified that ex- plain the conditions encountered: “O3-South”, “Cold Surge” and “O3-North”. These can be diagnosed from a combina- tion of synoptic and basin observations based on whether the day was predominantly cloudy, or whether the O3 peak was in the north or south of the basin. O3-South days have weak synoptic forcing due to an anti-cyclone over the east- ern Pacific. Strong solar heating leads to northerly flows in the basin and an evening shift due to a gap flow from the south-east. Peak ozone concentrations are in the convergence zone in the south of the city. Cold Surge days are associated with “El Norte” events, with strong surface northerlies bring- ing cold moist air and rain. Stable conditions lead to high concentrations of primary pollutants and peak ozone in the city center. O3-North days occur when the sub-tropical jet is closer toMexico City. With strong westerlies aloft, the circu- lation pattern is the same as O3-South days except for a wind shift in themid-afternoon leading to ozone peaks in the north of the city. This classification is proposed as a means of un- derstanding pollutant transport in the Mexico City basin and as a basis for future meteorological and chemical analysis. Furthermore, model evaluation and design of policy recom- mendations will need to take into account the three episode types.},

This study examined the relation between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and type 2 diabetes prevalence among 50- to 75-year-old subjects living in Westfriesland, the Netherlands. {METHODS:} Participants were recruited in a cross-sectional diabetes screening-study conducted between 1998 and 2000. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution was characterized at the participants' home-address. Indicators of exposure were land use regression modeled nitrogen dioxide ({NO2)} concentration, distance to the nearest main road, traffic flow at the nearest main road and traffic in a 250 m circular buffer. Crude and age-, gender- and neighborhood income adjusted associations were examined by logistic regression. {RESULTS:} 8,018 participants were included, of whom 619 (8\%) subjects had type 2 diabetes. Smoothed plots of exposure versus type 2 diabetes supported some association with traffic in a 250 m buffer (the highest three quartiles compared to the lowest also showed increased prevalence, though non-significant and not increasing with increasing quartile), but not with the other exposure metrics. Modeled {NO2-concentration}, distance to the nearest main road and traffic flow at the nearest main road were not associated with diabetes. Exposure-response relations seemed somewhat more pronounced for women than for men (non-significant). {CONCLUSIONS:} We did not find consistent associations between type 2 diabetes prevalence and exposure to traffic-related air pollution, though there were some indications for a relation with traffic in a 250 m buffer.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Daily air pollution is associated with increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases, but there are few observations on the link with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the relation between various urban air pollutants (total suspended particulate, {SO2}, {CO}, {NO2)} and hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Rome, Italy, we performed a case-crossover analysis and studied whether individual characteristics act as effect modifiers. {METHODS:} We studied 6531 subjects residing in Rome and hospitalized for a first episode of acute myocardial infarction (International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition: 410) from January 1995 to June 1997. The following individual information was available: sex, age, date of hospitalization, coexisting illnesses (hypertension, 25\%; diabetes, 15\%), and cardiac severity (conduction disorders, 6\%; cardiac dysrhythmias, 20\%; heart failure, 11\%). Daily air pollution data were taken from 5 city monitors. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design; control days were the same day of the week as the myocardial infarction occurred, in other weeks of the month. {RESULTS:} Positive associations were found for total suspended particulate, {NO2} and {CO.} The strongest and most consistent effect was found for total suspended particulate. The odds ratio ({OR)} associated with 10 micro g/m3 of total suspended particulate over the 0- to 2-day lag was 1.028 (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} = 1.005-1.052). The association with total suspended particulate tended to be stronger among people older than 74 years of age ({OR} = 1.046; {CI} = 1.005-1.089), in the warm period of the year ({OR} = 1.046; {CI} = 1.008-1.087), and among subjects who had heart conduction disorders ({OR} = 1.080; {CI} = 0.987-1.181). {CONCLUSIONS:} The results suggest that air pollution increases the risk of myocardial infarction, especially during the warm season. There was a tendency for a stronger effect among the elderly and people with heart conduction disturbances.},

However, air masses always contain many pollutants in differing amounts, depending on the types of emission sources and atmospheric conditions. Because humans are simultaneously exposed to a complex mixture of air pollutants, many organizations have encouraged moving towards "a multipollutant approach to air quality." Although there is general agreement that multipollutant approaches are desirable, the challenges of implementing them are vast.},

  Abstract                 = {Airborne particulate matter ({PM)} may lead to increased cardiac risk through an inflammatory pathway. Therefore, we investigated associations between ambient {PM} and markers of systemic inflammation among repeated measures from 44 senior citizens ({\textgreater}/= 60 years of age) and examined susceptibility by conditions linked to chronic inflammation. Mixed models were used to identify associations between concentrations of fine {PM} [aerodynamic diameter {\textless}/= 2.5 microm ({PM2.5)]} averaged over 1-7 days and measures of C-reactive protein ({CRP)} , interleukin-6 ({IL-6)} , and white blood cells ({WBCs)} . Effect modification was investigated for diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and elevated mean inflammatory markers. We found positive associations between longer moving averages of {PM2.5} and {WBCs} across all participants, with a 5.5\% [95\% confidence interval ({CI)} , 0.10 to 11\%] increase per interquartile increase (5.4 microg/m3) of {PM2.5} averaged over the previous week. {PM2.5} and {CRP} also exhibited positive associations among all individuals for averages longer than 1 day, with the largest associations for persons with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. For example, an interquartile increase in the 5-day mean {PM)2.5} (6.1 microg/m3) was associated with a 14\% increase in {CRP} (95\% {CI}, -5.4 to 37\%) for all individuals and an 81\% (95\% {CI}, 21 to 172\%) increase for persons with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Persons with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension also exhibited positive associations between {PM2.5} and {IL-6.} Individuals with elevated mean inflammatory markers exhibited enhanced associations with {CRP}, {IL-6}, and {WBCs.} We found modest positive associations between {PM2.5} and indicators of systemic inflammation, with larger associations suggested for individuals with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and elevated mean inflammatory markers.},

  Abstract                 = {An episode of hyperthermia is not uncommon during pregnancy. The consequences depend on the extent of temperature elevation, its duration, and the stage of development when it occurs. Mild exposures during the preimplantation period and more severe exposures during embryonic and fetal development often result in prenatal death and abortion. Hyperthermia also causes a wide range of structural and functional defects. The central nervous system ({CNS)} is most at risk probably because it cannot compensate for the loss of prospective neurons by additional divisions by the surviving neuroblasts and it remains at risk at stages throughout pre- and postnatal life. In experimental animals the most common defects are of the neural tube, microphthalmia, cataract, and micrencephaly, with associated functional and behavioral problems. Defects of craniofacial development including clefts, the axial and appendicular skeleton, the body wall, teeth, and heart are also commonly found. Nearly all these defects have been found in human epidemiological studies following maternal fever or hyperthermia during pregnancy. Suggested future human studies include problems of {CNS} function after exposure to influenza and fever, including mental retardation, schizophrenia, autism, and cerebral palsy.},

  Abstract                 = {Land Use Regression ({LUR)} models have been used increasingly for modeling small-scale spatial variation in air pollution concentrations and estimating individual exposure for participants of cohort studies. Within the {ESCAPE} project, concentrations of {PM2.5}, {PM2.5} absorbance, {PM10}, and {PMcoarse} were measured in 20 European study areas at 20 sites per area. {GIS-derived} predictor variables (e.g., traffic intensity, population, and land-use) were evaluated to model spatial variation of annual average concentrations for each study area. The median model explained variance (R2) was 71\% for {PM2.5} (range across study areas 35?94\%). Model R2 was higher for {PM2.5} absorbance (median 89\%, range 56?97\%) and lower for {PMcoarse} (median 68\%, range 32? 81\%). Models included between two and five predictor variables, with various traffic indicators as the most common predictors. Lower R2 was related to small concentration variability or limited availability of predictor variables, especially traffic intensity. Cross validation R2 results were on average 8?11\% lower than model R2. Careful selection of monitoring sites, examination of influential observations and skewed variable distributions were essential for developing stable {LUR} models. The final {LUR} models are used to estimate air pollution concentrations at the home addresses of participants in the health studies involved in {ESCAPE.}},

  Abstract                 = {The {ESCAPE} study (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) investigates relationships between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and health using cohort studies across Europe. This paper analyses the spatial variation of {PM2.5}, {PM2.5} absorbance, {PM10} and {PMcoarse} concentrations between and within 20 study areas across Europe. We measured {NO2}, {NOx}, {PM2.5}, {PM2.5} absorbance and {PM10} between October 2008 and April 2011 using standardized methods. {PMcoarse} was determined as the difference between {PM10} and {PM2.5.} In each of the twenty study areas, we selected twenty {PM} monitoring sites to represent the variability in important air quality predictors, including population density, traffic intensity and altitude. Each site was monitored over three 14-day periods spread over a year, using Harvard impactors. Results for each site were averaged after correcting for temporal variation using data obtained from a reference site, which was operated year-round. Substantial concentration differences were observed between and within study areas. Concentrations for all components were higher in Southern Europe than in Western and Northern Europe, but the pattern differed per component with the highest average {PM2.5} concentrations found in Turin and the highest {PMcoarse} in Heraklion. Street/urban background concentration ratios for {PMcoarse} (mean ratio 1.42) were as large as for {PM2.5} absorbance (mean ratio 1.38) and higher than those for {PM2.5} (1.14) and {PM10} (1.23), documenting the importance of non-tailpipe emissions. Correlations between components varied between areas, but were generally high between {NO2} and {PM2.5} absorbance (average R2����=����0.80). Correlations between {PM2.5} and {PMcoarse} were lower (average R2����=����0.39). Despite high correlations, concentration ratios between components varied, e.g. the {NO2/PM2.5} ratio varied between 0.67 and 3.06. In conclusion, substantial variability was found in spatial patterns of {PM2.5}, {PM2.5} absorbance, {PM10} and {PMcoarse.} The highly standardized measurement of particle concentrations across Europe will contribute to a consistent assessment of health effects across Europe.},

Over the years several global nighttime lights products have been generated. {NGDC} has now produced a set of global cloud-free nighttime lights products, specifically processed for the detection of changes in lighting emitted by human settlements, spanning 1992-93 to 2008. While the {OLS} is far from ideal for observing nighttime lights, the {DMSP} nighttime lights products have been successfully used in modeling the spatial distribution of population density, carbon emissions, and economic activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Aerosol spatial distribution in populated mountain areas is very heterogeneous and often characterized by scales of variability of several kilometers. Satellites provide an effective tool to map aerosols on an operational basis, but most of the aerosol products intended for continental/global applications have a coarse spatial resolution (10������18 km). The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction ({MAIAC)} is a recently developed algorithm for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)}, which provides Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} at a high resolution of 1 km. We analyze the quality and potential of {MAIAC} {AOD} in the Alpine region and we derive high resolution {AOD} maps for the years 2008 and 2009. Cloudiness and snow in mountain regions occasionally lead to an overestimation of {AOD} due to unresolved cloud and snow pixel contamination. Therefore, we developed a filter that almost preserves the spatial resolution of the product to ensure the good accuracy of {MAIAC} {AOD} for air-quality and climatological applications. The {AOD} is validated with {AERONET} measurements in the region and compared to the standard {MODIS} {AOD} product ({MOD04).} Similar accuracies are found for both products ({RMSE} = 0.05) but with {MAIAC} providing about 50\% more observations at the examined locations, because of its higher spatial resolution and less restrictive filtering. Comparison with ground measurements of aerosol mass ({PM10)} shows that {MAIAC} {AOD} can be used to detect the fine scales of aerosol variability (2������3 km) in the mountains. Finally, {AOD} maps for the Alpine region demonstrate that topography is correlated with the average aerosol spatial distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Epidemiological studies suggest an association between exposure to particulate matter ({PM)} in air pollution and risk of venous thromboembolism ({VTE).} Objectives: To investigate the underlying pathophysiological pathways linking {PM} exposure and {VTE.} Methods: We assessed potential associations between {PM} exposure and coagulation and inflammation parameters, including circulating microvesicles, in a group of 233 patients with diabetes. Results: The numbers of circulating blood platelet-derived and annexin V-binding microvesicles were inversely associated with the current levels of {PM(2.5)} or {PM(10)} , measured on the day of sampling. Recent past exposure to {PM(10)} , up to 1 week prior to blood sampling, estimated at the patients' residential addresses, was associated with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ({CRP)}, leukocytes and fibrinogen, as well as with tissue factor-dependent procoagulant changes in thrombin generation assays. When longer windows of past exposure were considered, up to 1 year preceding blood sampling, procoagulant changes were evident from the strongly increased numbers of red blood cell-derived circulating microvesicles and annexin V-binding microvesicles, but they no longer associated with tissue factor. Past {PM} exposure was never associated with activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT)}, prothrombin time ({PT)}, or factor (F) {VII}, {FVIII}, {FXII} or D-dimers. Residential distance to a major road was only marginally correlated with procoagulant changes in {FVIII} and thrombin generation. Conclusions: Increases in the number of microvesicles and in their procoagulant properties, rather than increases in coagulation factors per se, seem to contribute to the risk of {VTE}, developing during prolonged exposure to air pollutants.},

The impact of air pollution relative to other causes of death in a population is of public health importance and has not been well established. In this study, the rate advancement periods associated with traffic pollution exposures were estimated. Study subjects underwent pulmonary function testing at a clinic in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, between 1985 and 1999. Cox regression was used to model mortality from all natural causes during 1992-2001 in relation to lung function, body mass index, a diagnosis of chronic pulmonary disease, chronic ischemic heart disease, or diabetes mellitus, household income, and residence within 50 m of a major urban road or within 100 m of a highway. Subjects living close to a major road had an increased risk of mortality (relative risk = 1.18, 95\% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.38). The mortality rate advancement period associated with residence near a major road was 2.5 years (95\% confidence interval: 0.2, 4.8). By comparison, the rate advancement periods attributable to chronic pulmonary disease, chronic ischemic heart disease, and diabetes were 3.4 years, 3.1 years, and 4.4 years, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {{RATIONALE:} Out-of-hospital coronary heart disease death is a major public health problem, but the association with air pollution is not well understood. {OBJECTIVES:} We evaluated the association between daily ambient air pollution levels (particle number concentration [{PNC]--a} proxy for ultrafine particles [diameter {\textless} 0.1 microm], mass of particles with diameter less than 10 microm [{PM10];} {CO}, {NO2}, and O3) and the occurrence of fatal, nonhospitalized coronary events. {METHODS:} Subjects were 5,144 out-of-hospital fatalities (410-414, International Classification of Diseases-9; 1998-2000) who had been residents of Rome. Hospitalizations during the 3 yr before death were considered to identify comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, dysrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Statistical analyses were performed using a case-crossover design. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS:} The association with out-of-hospital coronary deaths was statistically significant for {PNC}, {PM10}, and {CO.} Air pollution on the day of death had the strongest effect (e.g., 7.6\% increase [95\% confidence interval, 2.0-13.6\%]) for an interquartile range of {PNC}, 27,790 particles/cm3. The 65-74- and 75+-yr age groups were at higher risk than the 35-64-yr age group, and there was a suggestion of effect modification for people with hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. {CONCLUSIONS:} Air pollutants originating from combustion processes, including ultrafine particles, are related to fatal, nonhospitalized coronary events. The effect is stronger among people over 65 years of age, but is not limited to a group with a specific comorbidity.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Short-term increases in particulate air pollution are linked with increased daily mortality and morbidity. Socioeconomic status ({SES)} is a determinant of overall health. We investigated whether social class is an effect modifier of the {PM(10)} (particulate matter with diameter {\textless}10 micron)-daily mortality association, and possible mechanisms for this effect modification. {METHODS:} Area-based traffic emissions, income, and {SES} were available for each resident in Rome. All natural deaths (83,253 subjects) occurring in Rome among city residents (aged 35+ years) during the period 1998-2001 were identified. For each deceased individual, all the previous hospitalizations within 2 years before death were available via a record linkage procedure. {PM(10)} daily data were available from two urban monitoring sites. A case-crossover analysis was utilized in which control days were selected according to the time stratified approach (same day of the week during the same month). Conditional logistic regression was used. {RESULTS:} Due to the social class distribution in the city, exposure to traffic emissions was higher among those with higher area-based income and {SES.} Meanwhile, people of lower social class had suffered to a larger extent from chronic diseases before death than more affluent residents, especially diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Overall, {PM(10)} (lag 0-1) was strongly associated with mortality (1.1\% increase, {95\%CI} = 0.7-1.6\%, per 10 microg/m(3)). The effect was more pronounced among persons with lower income and {SES} (1.9\% and 1.4\% per 10 microg/m(3), respectively) compared to those in the upper income and {SES} levels (0.0\% and 0.1\%, respectively). {CONCLUSIONS:} The results confirm previous suggestions of a stronger effect of particulate air pollution among people in low social class. Given the uneven geographical distributions of social deprivation and traffic emissions in Rome, the most likely explanation is a differential burden of chronic health conditions conferring a greater susceptibility to less advantaged people.},

In particular, a strong epidemiologic association is observed between acute and chronic exposures to particulate matter and the occurrence of cardiovascular events, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and venous thromboembolism, especially among older people and people with diabetes and previous cardiovascular conditions. Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to cause the increase in atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events, including the activation by particulate matter of inflammatory pathways and hemostasis factors, production of reactive oxygen species through the oxidative stress pathway, alterations in vascular tone, and decreased heart rate variability (a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction and a predictor of sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias). Current knowledge on the biologic mechanisms and the clinical effect of short- and long-term exposure to particulate air pollutants is discussed, emphasizing that life expectancy improved significantly in sites where air pollutants were controlled.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that exposure to road traffic is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Objectives We aimed to identify specific traffic-related air pollutants that are associated with the risk of coronary heart disease ({CHD)} morbidity and mortality to support evidence-based environmental policy making. Methods This population-based cohort study included a 5-year exposure period and a 4-year follow-up period. All residents 45������85 years of age who resided in Metropolitan Vancouver during the exposure period and without known {CHD} at baseline were included in this study (n = 452,735). Individual exposures to traffic-related air pollutants including black carbon, fine particles [aerodynamic diameter ������ 2.5 ����m ({PM2.5)]}, nitrogen dioxide ({NO2)}, and nitric oxide were estimated at residences of the subjects using land-use regression models and integrating changes in residences during the exposure period. {CHD} hospitalizations and deaths during the follow-up period were identified from provincial hospitalization and death registration records. Results An interquartile range elevation in the average concentration of black carbon (0.94 ���� 10������5/m filter absorbance, equivalent to approximately 0.8 ����g/m3 elemental carbon) was associated with a 3\% increase in {CHD} hospitalization (95\% confidence interval, 1������5\%) and a 6\% increase in {CHD} mortality (3������9\%) after adjusting for age, sex, preexisting comorbidity, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and copollutants ({PM2.5} and {NO2).} There were clear linear exposure������response relationships between black carbon and coronary events. Conclusions Long-term exposure to traffic-related fine particulate air pollution, indicated by black carbon, may partly explain the observed associations between exposure to road traffic and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Malaria transmission is strongly influenced by climatic conditions which determine the abundance and seasonal dynamics of the Anopheles vector. In particular, water temperature influences larval development rates whereas air temperature determines adult longevity as well as the rate of parasite development within the adult mosquito. Although data on land surface temperature exist at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km globally with four time steps per day, comparable data are not currently available for air temperature. In order to address this gap and demonstrate the importance of using the right type of temperature data, we fitted simple models of the relationship between land-surface and air temperature at lower resolution to obtain a high resolution estimate of air temperature across Africa. We then used these estimates to calculate some crucial malaria transmission parameters that strongly depend on air temperatures. Our results demonstrate substantial differences between air and surface temperatures that impact temperature-based maps of areas suitable for transmission. We present high resolution maps of the malaria transmission parameters driven by air temperature and their seasonal variation. The fitted air temperature datasets are made publicly available alongside this publication.},

  Note                     = {This paper reviews a number of methods for the exploration and modelling of spatial point patterns with particular reference to geographical epidemiology (the geographical incidence of disease). Such methods go well beyond the conventional 'nearest-neighbour' and 'quadrat' analyses which have little to offer in an epidemiological context because they fail to allow for spatial variation in population density. Correction for this is essential if the aim is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time clustering, and we consider methods for modelling the raised incidence of disease around suspected point sources of pollution. All methods are illustrated by reference to recent case studies including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood asthma. An Appendix considers a range of possible software environments within which to apply these methods. The links to modern geographical information systems are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In practice, spatial data are sometimes collected at points (i.e. point-referenced data) and at other times are associated with areal units (i.e. block data). The change of support problem is concerned with inference about the values of a variable at points or blocks different from those at which it has been observed. In the context of block data which can be sensibly viewed as averaging over point data, we propose a unifying approach for prediction from points to points, points to blocks, blocks to points, and blocks to blocks. The approach includes fully Bayesian kriging. We also extend our approach to the the case of spatio-temporal data, wherein a judicious specification of spatio-temporal association enables manageable computation. Exemplification of the static spatial case is provided using a dataset of point-level ozone measurements in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. The dynamic spatial case is illustrated using a temporally extended version of this dataset, enabling comparison at the common time {point.*To} whom correspondence should be addressed.},

  Abstract                 = {Present evidence suggests that venous thromboembolism is the third most common acute cardiovascular disease after cardiac ischemic syndromes and stroke. The frequency of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ({PE)} at a given hospital greatly increases if a referral unit for {PE} is set up in the hospital. Pulmonary embolism is characterized by a continuous spectrum of severity, from 2 to 3 to 15 to 16 embolized pulmonary segments (over a total of 19). Morbidity from {PE} increases with age and male sex (males/females ratio: 1.24). In only a minority (10\%) of patients with {PE} and/or deep-vein thrombosis ({DVT)}, primary deficiencies of coagulation-inhibiting proteins have been shown. Primary abnormalities of the fibrinolytic system seem even more rare. On the basis of the clinical conditions preceding the embolic episode, patients may be divided into different groups: apparently primary or idiopathic {PE} (40\%), surgery or trauma (43\%), heart disease (12\%), neoplastic disease (4\%), and systemic disease (1\%). Patients with apparently primary or idiopathic {PE} often develop subsequent clinically overt cancer (9.1\%), whereas surgery or trauma patients rarely do (1.4\%). Furthermore, the former exhibit a significantly shorter survival than the latter mostly for causes of death that reflect increased predisposition to thrombogenesis. Thus, as for {DVT}, it is convenient to consider a primary or idiopathic form also for {PE.}},

  Abstract                 = {Earth-observing satellites have provided an unprecedented view of the land surface but have been exploited relatively little for the measurement of environmental variables of particular relevance to epidemiology. Recent advances in techniques to recover continuous fields of air temperature, humidity, and vapour pressure deficit from remotely sensed observations have significant potential for disease vector monitoring and related epidemiological applications. We report on the development of techniques to map environmental variables with relevance to the prediction of the relative abundance of disease vectors and intermediate hosts. Improvements to current methods of obtaining information on vegetation properties, canopy and surface temperature and soil moisture over large areas are also discussed. Algorithms used to measure these variables incorporate visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared radiation observations derived from time series of satellite-based sensors, focused here primarily but not exclusively on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ({AVHRR)} instruments. The variables compare favourably with surface measurements over a broad array of conditions at several study sites, and maps of retrieved variables captured patterns of spatial variability comparable to, and locally more accurate than, spatially interpolated meteorological observations. Application of multi-temporal maps of these variables are discussed in relation to current epidemiological research on the distribution and abundance of some common disease vectors.},

Heart rate variability ({HRV)} was assessed through time domain variables: the standard deviation of normal {RR} intervals ({SDNN)} and the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal {RR} intervals (r-{MSSD).} Mean 4-hour {PM(2.5)} levels ranged from 3 to 49 microg/m(3); 1-hour ozone levels ranged from 1 to 77 ppb. In multivariate analyses, significantly less {HRV} ({SDNN} and r-{MSSD)} was associated with elevated {PM(2.5).} During slow breathing, a reduction in r-{MSSD} of 6.1 ms was associated with an interquartile (14.3 microg/m(3)) increase in {PM(2.5)} during the hour of and the 3 hours previous to the Holter session (P=0.006). During slow breathing, a multiple pollution model was associated with a reduction in r-{MSSD} of 5.4 ms (P=0.02) and 5.5 ms (P=0.03) for interquartile changes in {PM(2.5)} and ozone, respectively, resulting in a combined effect equivalent to a 33\% reduction in the mean r-{MSSD.} {CONCLUSIONS:} Particle and ozone exposure may decrease vagal tone, resulting in reduced {HRV.}},

  Abstract                 = {This study was undertaken in order to shed light on which groups of the general population may be susceptible to the effects of ambient particles. The objectives of the study were (1) to determine whether concentrations of particles in the ambient air of Montreal, Quebec, were associated with daily all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the period 1984 to 1993, and (2) to determine whether groups of the population had higher than average risks of death from exposure to particles. From the network of fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal we obtained daily mean levels of various measures of particles, gaseous pollutants, and weather variables measured at Dorval International Airport. We also used measurements of sulfate from an acid rain monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city (Sutton, Quebec). We estimated associations for particulate matter ({PM)} with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or smaller ({PM10)}, or 2.5 microns or smaller ({PM2.5)}, total suspended particles ({TSP)}, coefficient of haze ({COH)}, an extinction coefficient, and sulfate. Because substantial data for fine particles were missing, we developed a regression model to predict {PM2.5} and to predict sulfate from {PM2.5.} In the main body of the report, we present results for {COH}, predicted {PM2.5}, and sulfate. Detailed results for all pollutants are included in Appendices H through O, which are available on request from Health Effects Institute and from the {HEI} web site at www.healtheffects.org. To address the first objective, we made use of the underlying causes of death among all 140,939 residents of Montreal who died between 1984 and 1993. We regressed the logarithm of daily counts of cause-specific mortality on the daily mean levels for a variety of measures of particles, accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, overdispersion, and weather factors. To address the second objective, we developed algorithms to define conditions that subjects had prior to death, with the focus on cardiopulmonary diseases. These algorithms were based on information retained on the databases of the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan ({QHIP).} The databases include records of all procedures (e.g., type of surgery), physician visits, and consultations carried out by all physicians in Quebec. For persons {\textgreater} or = 65 years and for all recipients of social assistance the prescription database contains records of all pharmaceuticals dispensed (type of medication, dose, quantity). For each group of conditions defined, we used the same statistical model that was used in the analyses of all nonaccidental causes of death. In the analyses of cause-specific mortality, we found evidence of associations for all nonaccidental causes of death and specific causes of death--cancer, coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, and diabetes--that were consistent across most metrics of ambient air particle concentrations, evaluated as the 3-day mean of particle concentrations measured on the day of death (lag 0) and on each of the two days before death (lag 1, lag 2). Associations for all cardiovascular diseases combined were found only with sulfate. As well, we generally found increased daily mortality for persons 65 years of age and over. The results for all nonaccidental causes of death are similar to findings from other studies; the mean percent increase in mortality for a 100 micrograms/m3 increase in daily {TSP} at lag 0 was 6.7\%. In the analyses of the groups defined from the {QHIP} data, there was little evidence of associations with air pollutants among persons who before death were classified as having acute or chronic upper respiratory diseases, airways diseases, hypertension, acute coronary artery diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. On the other hand, we found consistent increases across most types of ambient particles for persons who had cancer, acute lower respiratory diseases, any form of cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary artery diseases, and congestive heart failure. As well, we found an association for individuals who did not have any cardiovascular disease, lower respiratory diseases, and cancer. This latter group consisted of persons who had no interactions with the health care system one year before death (12\%) and individuals with a wide variety of potentially fatal diseases (52\%), including neurological conditions (12\%), diabetes (8\%), cardiac dysrhythmias (8\%), dementia (6\%), organic psychotic disorders (6\%), and anemias (4\%). As statistical power was reduced in the analyses presented above, differences between groups (e.g., {\textless} 65 and {\textgreater} or = 65 year age groups) were not usually statistically significant. The association with diabetes has not been reported previously, and this needs to be replicated in other studies. ({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED)}},

  Abstract                 = {This study was undertaken to determine whether variations in concentrations of particulates in the ambient air of Montreal, Quebec, during the period 1984 to 1993, were associated with daily variations in cause-specific daily mortality. Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of various measures of particles and gaseous pollutants. Total sulfate was also measured daily (1986-1993) at a monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city (Sutton, Quebec). We used coefficient of haze ({COH)}, extinction coefficient, and sulfate from the Sutton station to predict fine particles and sulfate from fine particles for days that were missing. We estimated associations between cause-specific mortality and {PM(2.5)}, {PM(10)}, predicted fine particles and fine sulfate particles, total suspended particles, coefficient of haze, extinction coefficient, and total sulfate measured at the Sutton station. We selected a set of underlying causes of death, as recorded on the death certificates, as the endpoint and then regressed the logarithm of daily counts of cause-specific mortality on the daily mean levels for the above measures of particulates, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and gaseous pollutants. We found positive and statistically significant associations between the daily measures of ambient particle mass and sulfate mass and the deaths from respiratory diseases and diabetes. The mean percentage change in daily mortality ({MPC)}, evaluated at the interquartile range for pollutants averaged over the day of death and the preceding 2 days, for deaths from respiratory diseases was {MPC(COH)=6.90\%} (95\% {CI:} 3.69-10.21\%), {MPC(Predicted} {PM2.5)=} 9.03\% (95\% {CI:} 5.83- 12.33\%), and {MPC(Sutton} sulfate)=4.64\% (95\% {CI:} 2.46-6.86\%). For diabetes, the corresponding estimates were {MPC(COH)=7.50\%} (95\% {CI:} 1.96-13.34\%), {MPC(Predicted} {PM2.5)=7.59\%} (95\% {CI:} 2.36-13.09\%), and {MPC(Sutton} sulfate)=4.48\% (95\% {CI:} 1.08-7.99\%). Among individuals older than 65 years at time of death, we found consistent associations across our metrics of particles for neoplasms and coronary artery diseases. Associations with sulfate mass were also found among elderly persons who died of cardiovascular diseases and of lung cancer. These associations were consistent with linear relationships. The associations found for respiratory diseases and for cardiovascular diseases, especially in the elderly, are in line with some of the current hypotheses regarding mechanisms by which ambient particles may increase daily mortality. The positive associations found for cancer and for diabetes may be understood through a general hypothesis proposed by Frank and Tankersley, who suggested that persons in failing health may be at higher risk for external insults through the failure of regulating physiological set points. The association with diabetes may be interpreted in light of recent toxicological findings that inhalation of urban particles in animals increases blood pressure and plasmatic levels of endothelins that enhance vasoconstriction and alter electrophysiology. Further research to confirm these findings and to determine whether they are causal is warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {A longitudinal design is proposed to investigate the short-term effects of air pollution on health status. The study design exploits a new statistical methodology developed by Dewanji and Moolgavkar (2000, 2002) that makes use of a Poisson counting process for the incidence of events in a longitudinal cohort study. The methodology allows for modeling of subject-specific baseline hazards of multiple events and time-dependent ecological (i.e., daily levels of air pollution and weather conditions) and individual covariates (e.g., comorbid conditions, indices of declines in health status). The study will determine the association between short-term changes in air pollution and incidence of hospitalization, emergency department visits, "intermediate health conditions" (e.g., changes in health status reflected by changes in filled prescriptions), and mortality. Data from the universal Quebec medicare system are used, including data for residents of Montreal age 65 yr and above. The cohorts include individuals who have at baseline airways disease, chronic coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, dysrhythmias, and diabetes, and these will be followed for the incidence of the already mentioned adverse outcomes, adjusting for time-dependent individual and ecological covariates. This type of study will provide findings that can be used to confirm or refute results of time series analyses. Using a different methodology that includes subject-specific information will greatly increase our understanding as to whether short-term exposures to ambient air pollution cause serious changes in health status among subgroups of the population. These results will also help in understanding mechanisms by identifying groups that are susceptible to the effects of air pollution.},

We carried out this mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to confirm these observations and to determine whether diabetics who had other health conditions were also at higher risk of dying when air pollution increases. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS:} In one analysis, we related daily deaths from diabetes (using the underlying cause) to daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants. In another analysis, we created subgroups by identifying subjects diagnosed 1 year before death with diabetes and other major health conditions from billing and prescription data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan. The analysis made use of parametric log-linear Poisson models that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily weather conditions. We found positive associations between most air pollutants and daily mortality from diabetes as well as among subjects diagnosed with diabetes 1 year before death. In the latter group of subjects, greater effects were found generally in the warm season and especially among subjects who had diabetes and who also had any cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary disease, and atherosclerosis. We did not find evidence of associations among persons who only had diabetes (i.e., did not also have cancer, cardiovascular disease, or lower respiratory disease). {CONCLUSIONS:} These data indicate that individuals with diabetes who also have cardiovascular disease may be susceptible to the short-term effects of air pollution.},

We show that the group variable need not be a confounder (in the strict epidemiological sense) for ecological bias to occur: effect modification can lead to profound ecological bias, whether or not the group variable or the effect modifier are independent risk factors. Furthermore, an extraneous risk factor need not be associated with the study variable at the individual level in order to produce ecological bias. Thus the conditions for the production of ecological bias by a covariate are much broader than the conditions for the production of individual-level confounding by a covariate. We also show that standardization or ecological control of variables responsible for ecological bias are generally insufficient to remove such bias.},

  Abstract                 = {In many environmental epidemiology studies, the locations and/or times of exposure measurements and health assessments do not match. In such settings, health effects analyses often use the predictions from an exposure model as a covariate in a regression model. Such exposure predictions contain some measurement error as the predicted values do not equal the true exposures. We provide a framework for spatial measurement error modeling, showing that smoothing induces a Berkson-type measurement error with nondiagonal error structure. From this viewpoint, we review the existing approaches to estimation in a linear regression health model, including direct use of the spatial predictions and exposure simulation, and explore some modified approaches, including Bayesian models and out-of-sample regression calibration, motivated by measurement error principles. We then extend this work to the generalized linear model framework for health outcomes. Based on analytical considerations and simulation results, we compare the performance of all these approaches under several spatial models for exposure. Our comparisons underscore several important points. First, exposure simulation can perform very poorly under certain realistic scenarios. Second, the relative performance of the different methods depends on the nature of the underlying exposure surface. Third, traditional measurement error concepts can help to explain the relative practical performance of the different methods. We apply the methods to data on the association between levels of particulate matter and birth weight in the greater Boston area.},

Participants completed a semi-structured interview and testing for hepatitis B virus ({HBV)}, hepatitis C virus ({HCV)} and {HIV} infection. We examined whether travel was independently associated with drug, alcohol, sexual risk behaviors, and infection status, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and years injecting. {RESULTS:} Two-thirds (62\%) reported past (3 months) travel outside of San Francisco (n=355). Travelers, as compared to non-travelers, were more likely to be under age 20, female, and planned to leave San Francisco in the coming months. Travel was independently associated with heavy alcohol consumption, drinking alcohol until blackout, poly-substance use, more sexual and injecting partners, and receptive needle/syringe sharing, sharing drug preparation equipment, backloading syringes and pooling money to buy drugs. In an analysis of interactions with travel, younger travelers were more likely to be {HCV} positive than younger non-travelers. {DISCUSSION:} Traveling young {IDU} are at exceptionally high risk for acquiring and transmitting viral infections, while their mobility makes it challenging to effectively deliver interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {Background While exposures to high and low air temperatures are associated with cardiovascular mortality, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The risk factors for cardiovascular disease include high levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein ({LDL)}, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein ({HDL).} We investigated whether temperature was associated with changes in circulating lipid levels, and whether this might explain part of the association with increased cardiovascular events. Methods The study cohort consisted of 478 men in the greater Boston area with a mean age of 74.2 years. They visited the clinic every 3������5 years between 1995 and 2008 for physical examination and to complete questionnaires. We excluded from analyses all men taking statin medication and all days with missing data, resulting in a total of 862 visits. Associations between three temperature variables (ambient, apparent, and dew point temperature) and serum lipid levels (total cholesterol, {HDL}, {LDL}, and triglycerides) were studied with linear mixed models that included possible confounders such as air pollution and a random intercept for each subject. Results We found that {HDL} decreased ������1.76\% (95\% {CI:} from ������3.17 to ������0.32, lag 2 days), and ������5.58\% (95\% {CI:} from ������8.87 to ������2.16, moving average of 4 weeks) for each 5 {����C} increase in mean ambient temperature. For the same increase in mean ambient temperature, {LDL} increased by 1.74\% (95\% {CI:} 0.07������3.44, lag 1 day) and 1.87\% (95\% {CI:} 0.14������3.63, lag 2 days). These results were also similar for apparent and dew point temperatures. No changes were found in total cholesterol or triglycerides in relation to temperature increase. Conclusions Changes in {HDL} and {LDL} levels associated with an increase in ambient temperature may be among the underlying mechanisms of temperature-related cardiovascular mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives Cardiovascular mortality has been linked to changes in outdoor temperature. However, the mechanisms behind these effects are not well established. We aimed to study the effect of outdoor temperature on blood pressure, as increased blood pressure is a risk factor for cardiovascular death. Methods The study population consisted of men aged 53������100 years living in the Boston area. We used a mixed effects model to estimate the effect of three temperature variables: ambient, apparent and dew point temperature ({DPT)}, on repeated measures (every 3������5 years) of diastolic ({DBP)} and systolic blood pressure ({SBP).} Random intercepts for subjects and several possible confounders were used in the models, including black carbon and barometric pressure. Results We found modest associations between {DBP} and ambient and apparent temperature. In the basic models, {DBP} in association with a {5����C} decrease in 7-day moving averages of temperatures increased by 1.01\% (95\% {CI} ������0.06\% to 2.09\%) and 1.55\% (95\% {CI} 0.61\% to 2.49\%) for ambient and apparent temperature, respectively. Excluding extreme temperatures strengthened these associations (2.13\%, 95\% {CI} 0.66\% to 3.63\%, and 1.65\%, 95\% {CI} 0.41\% to 2.90\%, for ambient and apparent temperature, respectively). Effect estimates for {DPT} were close to null. The effect of apparent temperature on {SBP} was similar (1.30\% increase (95\% {CI} 0.32\% to 2.29\%) for a {5����C} decrease in 7-day moving average). Conclusions Cumulative exposure to decreasing ambient and apparent temperature may increase blood pressure. These findings suggest that an increase in blood pressure could be a mechanism behind cold-related, but not heat-related, cardiovascular mortality.},

Genotypes of 139 {SNPs} supposed to be involved in cardiac rhythm were identified in the literature. Using regression trees for longitudinal data, {SNPs} associated with {ECG} parameters were determined and included as potential air pollution effect modifiers. {RESULTS:} We observed concurrent and lagged decreases in {SDNN} by about 2-5\% in association with all air pollutants, especially in participants with at least one minor allele of rs332229. Increases in {PM{\textless}2.5mum} ({PM(2.5))} were associated with 4h-lagged decreases of -6.6\%[95\%-confidence interval:-10.6;-2.6\%] and -13.0\%[-20.7;-5.1\%] in {SDNN} in individuals with one or two minor alleles.

Differences among measuring methods and a lack of strict quality control in carrying out exposure assessment make it difficult to generalize and compare findings between studies. In this article, exposure assessment studies carried out in the developing world on several traffic-related air pollutants are reviewed. These pollutants include particulate matter ({PM)}, carbon monoxide ({CO)}, nitrogen dioxide ({NO2)}, volatile organic compounds ({VOCs)}, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs).} In addition, it discusses advantages and disadvantages of various monitoring methods (ambient fixed-site monitoring, microenvironment monitoring, and personal exposure assessment using portable samplers) for these pollutants in exposure assessment studies. Also included in this paper is a brief introduction of standards for these pollutants in ambient air or in occupational settings established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ({USEPA)}, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ({OSHA)} and the World Health Organization ({WHO).} The review ends with a summary of the limitations and gaps in recent studies and suggestions for future research in the developing world.},

We applied time-series modeling methods to nationally aggregated data on singleton births during the 456 months from January, 1973, through December, 2010. We found elevated odds of {VLBW} among male infants for relatively cold June and August temperatures. Unpleasant weather may figure in stress-related health outcomes, not only as a stressor, but also as a constraint on restoration.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Over the past decade, there has been a worldwide largely unexplained increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in young children. This study explores the quantitative role of exposure to specific air pollutants in the development of type 1 diabetes in children. {METHODS:} A total of 402 children were retrospectively studied. Zip code-related, time-specific birth-to-diagnosis exposure to five ambient air pollutants was obtained for 102 children with type 1 diabetes and 300 healthy children receiving care at a single hospital. Pollution exposure levels were created by summing up zip code-specific pollution data and dividing by months of exposure from birth to diagnosis. Analysis employed chi2, two-tailed independent sample t-test and unconditional logistic regression. {RESULTS:} Odds ratio ({OR)} was significantly high for cumulative exposure to ambient ozone (O3) and sulfate ({SO4)} in cases compared with controls, {OR} = 2.89 [95\% confidence interval ({CI)} = 1.80-4.62] and {OR} = 1.65 ({CI} = 1.20-2.28), respectively, even after adjustment for several potential confounders. Passive smoking was more frequent in children with diabetes (30 vs. 10\%, p = 0.001). Attending day care and breast feeding in infancy were less frequent in children with diabetes (14 vs. 23\%, p = 0.025; 59 vs. 78\%, p = 0.001). Family history of diabetes, autoimmune disease and drug abuse was more frequent in cases (p {\textless} 0.01). {CONCLUSION:} Cumulative exposure to ozone and sulfate in ambient air may predispose to the development of type 1 diabetes in children. Early infant formula feeding and passive smoking in the household may precipitate or accelerate the onset of type 1 diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies on the health effects of long-term average exposure to outdoor air pollution have played an important role in recent health impact assessments. Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression ({LUR)} models. {LUR} models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of {LUR} models. We identified 25 land-use regression studies. Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20������100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems ({GIS).} Monitoring is usually temporally limited: one to four surveys of typically one or two weeks duration. Significant predictor variables include various traffic representations, population density, land use, physical geography (e.g. altitude) and climate. Land-use regression methods have generally been applied successfully to model annual mean concentrations of {NO2}, {NOx}, {PM2.5}, the soot content of {PM2.5} and {VOCs} in different settings, including European and North-American cities. The performance of the method in urban areas is typically better or equivalent to geo-statistical methods, such as kriging, and dispersion models. Further developments of the land-use regression method include more focus on developing models that can be transferred to other areas, inclusion of additional predictor variables such as wind direction or emission data and further exploration of focalsum methods. Models that include a spatial and a temporal component are of interest for (e.g. birth cohort) studies that need exposure variables on a finer temporal scale. There is a strong need for validation of {LUR} models with personal exposure monitoring.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies showed that fine particulate matter ({PM2.5}, particles smaller than 2.5 ����m in aerodynamic diameter) is associated with various health outcomes. Ground in situ measurements of {PM2.5} concentrations are considered to be the gold standard, but are time-consuming and costly. Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth ({AOD)} products have the potential to supplement the ground monitoring networks to provide spatiotemporally-resolved {PM2.5} exposure estimates. However, the coarse resolutions (e.g., 10 km) of the satellite {AOD} products used in previous studies make it very difficult to estimate urban-scale {PM2.5} characteristics that are crucial to population-based {PM2.5} health effects research. In this paper, a new aerosol product with 1 km spatial resolution derived by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction ({MAIAC)} algorithm was examined using a two-stage spatial statistical model with meteorological fields (e.g., wind speed) and land use parameters (e.g., forest cover, road length, elevation, and point emissions) as ancillary variables to estimate daily mean {PM2.5} concentrations. The study area is the southeastern {U.S.}, and data for 2003 were collected from various sources. A cross validation approach was implemented for model validation. We obtained R2 of 0.83, mean prediction error ({MPE)} of 1.89 ����g/m3, and square root of the mean squared prediction errors ({RMSPE)} of 2.73 ����g/m3 in model fitting, and R2 of 0.67, {MPE} of 2.54 ����g/m3, and {RMSPE} of 3.88 ����g/m3 in cross validation. Both model fitting and cross validation indicate a good fit between the dependent variable and predictor variables. The results showed that 1 km spatial resolution {MAIAC} {AOD} can be used to estimate {PM2.5} concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {Insight into the occurrence of and the association between certain socio-economic variables and life-style characteristics is necessary for preventive nutrition and health policy. The prevalence of and the interdependencies among these variables were examined in 1930 men and 2204 women aged 19 to 85 who participated in the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 1987-1988. Dietary data were based on a two-day record. The associations among discrete variables were analysed using log-linear models. Analysis of covariance was used to explore the effects of the aggregate socio-economic status ({SES)} on dietary intake and anthropometry, whereas differences in food intake and {SES} were assessed by the non-parametric test of Kruskal and Wallis. In comparison to subjects with a high {SES} in people with a low {SES} a higher proportion of smokers (48 vs 32 per cent) was observed, a higher prevalence of obesity (39 vs 28 per cent), a higher percentage of heavy coffee drinkers (greater than six cups per day, 23 vs 17 per cent), and more subjects who skipped breakfast (19 vs 11 per cent). In the highest {SES} class more subjects used nutritional supplements (18 vs 11 per cent), more subjects followed a dietary rule (five vs two per cent), such as a vegetarian diet, and a higher proportion used more than three alcoholic drinks per day (19 vs 15 per cent). A higher {SES} was associated with a lower fat intake, but the differences (expressed as per cent of energy intake) were rather small and even absent among women when the contribution of alcohol to energy was not taken into account. In general, dietary intake among subjects in higher {SES} groups tended to be closer to dietary recommendations. The results indicate that a lower {SES} is accompanied by a higher prevalence of several indicators of an unhealthy life-style.},

The mitogenic activity of cells expressing H-{RasV12} was inhibited by treatment with the chemical antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK)} activity was decreased and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ({JNK)} was not activated in H-{RasV12-transformed} cells. Thus, H-{RasV12-induced} transformation can lead to the production of {.O2-} through one or more pathways involving a flavoprotein and Rac1. The implication of a reactive oxygen species, probably {.O2-}, as a mediator of Ras-induced cell cycle progression independent of {MAPK} and {JNK} suggests a possible mechanism for the effects of antioxidants against Ras-induced cellular transformation.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Population studies suggest that persons with diabetes are more sensitive to the effects of particulate matter ({PM)} air pollution. However, the biological mechanisms of a possible prothrombotic effect underlying this enhanced susceptibility remain largely unknown. {OBJECTIVE:} We hypothesized that exposure to {PM} causes prothrombotic changes in persons with diabetes, possibly via systemic inflammation. {METHODS:} Our study included 137 nonsmoking adults with diabetes who were outpatients at the University Hospital Leuven. Recent exposure (2 hr before examination) to ambient {PM} was measured at the entrance of the hospital. Individual chronic exposure to {PM} was assessed by measuring the area occupied by carbon in airway macrophages obtained by sputum induction. Platelet function was measured ex vivo with the {PFA-100} platelet function analyzer, which simulates a damaged blood vessel; we analyzed the function of platelets in primary hemostasis under high shear conditions. Total and differential blood leukocytes were counted. {RESULTS:} Independent of antiplatelet medication, an interquartile range ({IQR)} increase of 39.2 microg/m3 in {PM10} ({PM} with aerodynamic diameter {\textless}or= 10 microm) concentration measured 2 hr before the clinical examination (recent exposure) was associated with a decrease of 21.1 sec [95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 35.3 to 6.8] in the {PFA-100} closure time (i.e., increased platelet activation) and an increase in blood leukocytes of 512 per microliter of blood (95\% {CI}, 45.2979). Each area increase of 0.25 microm2 ({IQR)} in carbon load of airway macrophages (chronic exposure) was associated with an increase of 687 leukocytes per microliter of blood (95\% {CI}, 2241,150). {CONCLUSIONS:} A relevant increase in recent {PM} exposure was associated with a change in platelet function toward a greater prothrombotic tendency. The magnitude of the change was about two-thirds (in the opposite direction) of the average effect of antiplatelet medication. Diabetic patients showed evidence of proinflammatory response to both recent and chronic exposure to {PM} air pollution.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Epidemiologic studies indirectly suggest that air pollution accelerates atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that individual exposure to particulate matter ({PM)} derived from fossil fuel would correlate with plasma concentrations of oxidized low-density lipoprotein ({LDL)}, taken as a marker of atherosclerosis. We tested this hypothesis in patients with diabetes, who are at high risk for atherosclerosis. {METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS:} In a cross-sectional study of non-smoking adult outpatients with diabetes we assessed individual chronic exposure to {PM} by measuring the area occupied by carbon in airway macrophages, collected by sputum induction and by determining the distance from the patient's residence to a major road, through geocoding. These exposure indices were regressed against plasma concentrations of oxidized {LDL}, von Willebrand factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ({PAI-1).} We could assess the carbon load of airway macrophages in 79 subjects (58 percent). Each doubling in the distance of residence from major roads was associated with a 0.027 microm(2) decrease (95\% confidence interval ({CI):} -0.048 to -0.0051) in the carbon load of airway macrophages. Independently from other covariates, we found that each increase of 0.25 microm(2) [interquartile range ({IQR)]} in carbon load was associated with an increase of 7.3 {U/L} (95\% {CI:} 1.3 to 13.3) in plasma oxidized {LDL.} Each doubling in distance of residence from major roads was associated with a decrease of -2.9 {U/L} (95\% {CI:} -5.2 to -0.72) in oxidized {LDL.} Neither the carbon load of macrophages nor the distance from residence to major roads, were associated with plasma von Willebrand factor or {PAI-1.} {CONCLUSIONS:} The observed positive association, in a susceptible group of the general population, between plasma oxidized {LDL} levels and either the carbon load of airway macrophages or the proximity of the subject's residence to busy roads suggests a proatherogenic effect of traffic air pollution.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this experiment was to design a suitable mouse model for male subfertility In which to study the effect of decreased sperm quality on embryo quality in vivo and in vitro. To achieve male subfertility, testes of adult male mice were immersed in water at either {42����C} (heated) or {33����C} (controls) during 20 mint. Twenty-eight days after treatment, all heat stressed males showed a significant decrease in relative testis weight [384.7 mg in controls (286.7������460.6) verses 323 mg in stress heated groups (117.9������405.6); P {\textless} 0.001], sperm concentration [3.75 ���� 106/ml (2.75������7.25) verses 1.00 ���� 1.00 ���� 106 (0������4.00); P {\textless} 0.001] and progressive sperm motility [57.5\% (48.0������79.0) versus 42.5\% (14.0������66.0); P {\textless} 0.001]. Moreover, after mating to heat exposed males, not only the number of pregnant females (20/22 verses 18/30) bet also the weight of their embryos [275.4 mg (78.7������339.4) verses 261.8 mg (68.1������339.0); P {\textless} 0.001] was significantly lower at 14.5 days post coitum when compared to controls. Neither the number of resorption sites nor the number of viable embryos per pregnant female was significantly different between groups, Also, the in-vitro fertilization rate of oocytes, fertilized by spermatozoa collected from heat stressed males, was significantly lower (44.9\%; P {\textless} 0.0001) when compared to controls (65,1\%; P {\textless} 0.0001). In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that male subfertility induced by acute scrotal heating may result in impaired sperm quality, reduced embryo weight in vivo and decreased fertilization rate in vitro.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Landscape ecologists often deal with aggregated data and multiscaled spatial phenomena. Recognizing the sensitivity of the results of spatial analyses to the definition of units for which data are collected is critical to characterizing landscapes with minimal bias and avoidance of spurious relationships. We introduce and examine the effect of data aggregation on analysis of landscape structure as exemplified through what has become known, in the statistical and geographical literature, as {theModifiable} Areal Unit Problem ({MAUP).} The {MAUP} applies to two separate, but interrelated, problems with spatial data analysis. The first is the ������scale problem������, where the same set of areal data is aggregated into several sets of larger areal units, with each combination leading to different data values and inferences. The second aspect of the {MAUP} is the ������zoning problem������, where a given set of areal units is recombined into zones that are of the same size but located differently, again resulting in variation in data values and, consequently, different conclusions. We conduct a series of spatial autocorrelation analyses based on {NDVI} (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to demonstrate how the {MAUP} may affect the results of landscape analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the broader-scale implications for the {MAUP} in landscape ecology and suggest approaches for dealing with this issue.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Several studies have reported that the risk of breast cancer decreases with increasing duration of breast-feeding. Whether breast-feeding is associated with a reduced risk of hereditary breast cancer in women who carry deleterious {BRCA1} and {BRCA2} mutations is currently unknown. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of women with deleterious mutations in either the {BRCA1} or the {BRCA2} gene. Study participants, drawn from an international cohort, were matched on the basis of {BRCA} mutation ({BRCA1} [n = 685] or {BRCA2} [n = 280]), year of birth (\{+/-\}2 years), and country of residence. The study involved 965 case subjects diagnosed with breast cancer and 965 control subjects who had no history of breast or ovarian cancer. Information on pregnancies and breast-feeding practices was derived from a questionnaire administered to the women during the course of genetic counseling. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios ({ORs)} for the risk of breast cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among women with {BRCA1} mutations, the mean total duration of breast-feeding was statistically significantly shorter for case subjects than for control subjects (6.0 versus 8.7 months, respectively; mean difference = 2.7 months, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} = 1.4 to 4.0; P{\textless}.001). The total duration of breast-feeding was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (for each month of breast-feeding, {OR} = 0.98, 95\% {CI} = 0.97 to 0.99; Ptrend{\textless}.001). Women with {BRCA1} mutations who breast-fed for more than 1 year were less likely to have breast cancer than those who never breast-fed ({OR} = 0.55, 95\% {CI} = 0.38 to 0.80; P = .001), although no such association was seen for {BRCA2} ({OR} = 0.95, 95\% {CI} = 0.56 to 1.59; P = .83). Conclusions: Women with deleterious {BRCA1} mutations who breast-fed for a cumulative total of more than 1 year had a statistically significantly reduced risk of breast cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of models to assess air pollution exposures within cities for assignment to subjects in health studies has been identified as a priority area for future research. This paper reviews models for assessing intraurban exposure under six classes, including: (i) proximity-based assessments, (ii) statistical interpolation, (iii) land use regression models, (iv) line dispersion models, (v) integrated emission-meteorological models, and (vi) hybrid models combining personal or household exposure monitoring with one of the preceding methods. We enrich this review of the modelling procedures and results with applied examples from Hamilton, Canada. In addition, we qualitatively evaluate the models based on key criteria important to health effects assessment research. Hybrid models appear well suited to overcoming the problem of achieving population representative samples while understanding the role of exposure variation at the individual level. Remote sensing and activity-space analysis will complement refinements in pre-existing methods, and with expected advances, the field of exposure assessment may help to reduce scientific uncertainties that now impede policy intervention aimed at protecting public health.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Cavum septum pellucidum ({CSP)} is commonly known marker of neurodevelopmental brain malformation. In {MR} imaging it is seen either as an isolated finding or with association of others developmental brain changes e.g. cavum vergae ({CV).} {AIM} {OF} {THE} {STUDY:} was to assess the frequency of {CSP} and {CV} associated with others brain developmental malformations in children. We also classified clinical syndromes in children with these structural brain malformations. {MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} The study was performed on 55 children, hospitalised in the Department of Pediatric Neurology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, between 1998-2006 with diagnosed {CSP} and/or {CV} in {MRI.} There were 29 girls and 26 boys aged 4 months-16 years old. Clinical history, clinical status and neurological findings in physical examination were main indication to perform brain {MRI.} {MRI} scans was done in {SE} T1, {FSE} T2, {PD}, {FLAIR}, {IR} T1 sequences, 3 and 5 mm depth, in vertical, frontal and axial surfaces, performed on 1,5 T machine Signa Horizon {HiSpeed} General Electric. {RESULTS:} There were 38 children with {CSP}, 12 children with {CSP} and {CV}, and 5 with {CV.} In 18/55 children (33\%) {CSP} was isolated, but in 37/55 children (67\%) {CSP} was coexisted with other brain structural malformations. The average age of diagnosis in isolated {CSP} was 10 years old, in coexisting malformation was 5 years. In half of the children, the reason of neuroimaging was epilepsy, in this 6/18 patient with isolated {CSP} or {CV.} 58\% of the study group had a normal mental development, but 35\% of children with additional brain malformation and 11\% of children with isolated {CSP} and {CV} were mentally retarded. {CONCLUSION:} 1. The majority of the children with {CSP} and {CV} had also coexisting brain malformations diagnosed in {MRI.} 2. {CSP} and {CV} coexisting with large brain malformation e.g. dysplasia septo-optica and agenesis of corpus callosum. were diagnosed earlier. 4. Mental retardation was diagnosed in 1/3 children with different structural brain malformation but also in 11\% of children with {CSP} and {CV} as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Hazardous chemicals escape to the environment by a number of natural and/or anthropogenic activities and may cause adverse effects on human health and the environment. Increased combustion of fossil fuels in the last century is responsible for the progressive change in the atmospheric composition. Air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide ({CO)}, sulfur dioxide ({SO2)}, nitrogen oxides ({NOx)}, volatile organic compounds ({VOCs)}, ozone (O3), heavy metals, and respirable particulate matter ({PM2.5} and {PM10)}, differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties, emission, time of disintegration and ability to diffuse in long or short distances. Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human health, affecting a number of different systems and organs. It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung disease, or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have also been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy. These effects of air pollutants on human health and their mechanism of action are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of the study reported here was to assess the association between air pollution and daily diabetes mortality in Shanghai. Death records were collected for all individuals who lived in the Zhabei district of Shanghai and died from diabetes from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2002. The authors used a time-series approach to study the acute effects of air pollution on diabetes mortality after controlling for long-term trends, weather variables, and day of the week. Each increase of 10 microg/m3 in {PM10}, {SO2}, or {NO2} was found to correspond, respectively, to a 1.006 (95 percent {CI:} 1.000-1.012), 1.011 (95 percent {CI:} 0.990-1.032), or 1.013 (95 percent {CI:} 1.000-1.026) relative risk of diabetes mortality in Shanghai. The air pollutants also were observed to have a greater effect on diabetics than on nondiabetics. These findings provide new evidence for the association between air pollution and diabetes mortality risk, and suggest that diabetics are more susceptible to air pollution than are nondiabetics.},

This high rate represents a marked increase from the end of the last century (2), and it probably has a multifactorial etiology. Air pollution, smoking, diet, alcohol, occupational exposures and stress are all considered as possible etiologic and risk factors (3). We put forward a hypothesis that one of the most important etiologic factors in the rapid growth rate of cancer is the change of light exposure that took place in the last 100 years, especially in the developed countries. Increased light exposure acting through the pineal gland reduces melatonin production, thereby diminishing the non-specific oncostatic effects of the pineal gland.},

  Abstract                 = {Near-surface air temperature (T a) is an important variable for various scientific communities, and many previous studies have attempted to estimate T a with high spatial resolution using remotely sensed data. The present study proposes a new, practical method for estimating T a near the land surface based on moisture conditions of the atmosphere and surface. First, match-up data sets of ground observations from 76 meteorological stations and satellite remote-sensing observations were established over the Republic of Korea during 2006. Four cases of atmospheric and surface moisture conditions were then determined using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer brightness temperatures (at 11 and 12 ����m) and the normalized difference water index for all match-ups. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis for each case, land surface temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index were statistically selected as significant independent variables for estimating T a using the development data set (75\% of the match-ups for each case). The T a values estimated from the multiple regression algorithm with different constants and coefficients for each case showed reasonably good performance (nearly zero mean bias and approximately {3����C} root mean square error) compared with the measured T a values used as the validation data set (25\% of the match-ups for each case). Thus, the proposed T a estimation approach based on moisture conditions of the atmosphere and surface is not confined to a specific season or land type and can be applied to all areas and seasons in the Republic of Korea.},

  Abstract                 = {Weather and climate play important roles in determining patterns of air quality over multiple scales in time and space, owing to the fact that emissions, transport, dilution, chemical transformation, and eventual deposition of air pollutants all can be influenced by meteorologic variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and mixing height. There is growing recognition that development of optimal control strategies for key pollutants like ozone and fine particles now requires assessment of potential future climate conditions and their influence on the attainment of air quality objectives. In addition, other air contaminants of relevance to human health, including smoke from wildfires and airborne pollens and molds, may be influenced by climate change. In this study, the focus is on the ways in which health-relevant measures of air quality, including ozone, particulate matter, and aeroallergens, may be affected by climate variability and change. The small but growing literature focusing on climate impacts on air quality, how these influences may play out in future decades, and the implications for human health is reviewed. Based on the observed and anticipated impacts, adaptation strategies and research needs are discussed.},

To form a continuous surface from individual observations, the {KD} technique does not require the presence of a parameter{\^{a}}����s value in a given location (e.g., the incidence rate of a disease). This feature of {KD} smoothing is especially beneficial for empirical studies in which individual observations are represented by geographic coordinates only and have no other attributes, required by more commonly used smoothing techniques, such as spline and kriging. In the present study, we illustrate the use of {KD} technique for a study of association between the geographical distributions of breast cancer cases and exposure to artificial illumination during nighttime (light-at-night or {LAN)} in the city of Haifa, Israel.},

  Abstract                 = {Land use regression ({LUR)} models provide good estimates of spatially resolved long-term exposures, but are poor at capturing short term exposures. Satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements have the potential to provide spatio-temporally resolved predictions of both long and short term exposures, but previous studies have generally showed relatively low predictive power. Our objective was to extend our previous work on day-specific calibrations of {AOD} data using ground {PM2.5} measurements by incorporating commonly used {LUR} variables and meteorological variables, thus benefiting from both the spatial resolution from the {LUR} models and the spatio-temporal resolution from the satellite models. Later we use spatial smoothing to predict {PM2.5} concentrations for day/locations with missing {AOD} measures. We used mixed models with random slopes for day to calibrate {AOD} data for 2000������2008 across New-England with monitored {PM2.5} measurements. We then used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate {PM2.5} in location������day pairs with missing {AOD}, using regional measured {PM2.5}, {AOD} values in neighboring cells, and land use. Finally, local (100����m) land use terms were used to model the difference between grid cell prediction and monitored value to capture very local traffic particles. Out-of-sample ten-fold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. For days with available {AOD} data we found high out-of-sample R2 (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.830, year to year variation 0.725������0.904). For days without {AOD} values, our model performance was also excellent (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.810, year to year variation 0.692������0.887). Importantly, these R2 are for daily, rather than monthly or yearly, values. Our model allows one to assess short term and long-term human exposures in order to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of ambient particles, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {{BackgroundMany} studies have reported significant associations between exposure to {PM2.5} and hospital admissions, but all have focused on the effects of short-term exposure. In addition all these studies have relied on a limited number of {PM2.5} monitors in their study regions, which introduces exposure error, and excludes rural and suburban populations from locations in which monitors are not available, reducing generalizability and potentially creating selection {bias.MethodsUsing} our novel prediction models for exposure combining land use regression with physical measurements (satellite aerosol optical depth) we investigated both the long and short term effects of {PM2.5} exposures on hospital admissions across New-England for all residents aged 65 and older. We performed separate Poisson regression analysis for each admission type: all respiratory, cardiovascular disease ({CVD)}, stroke and diabetes. Daily admission counts in each zip code were regressed against long and short-term {PM2.5} exposure, temperature, socio-economic data and a spline of time to control for seasonal trends in baseline {risk.ResultsWe} observed associations between both short-term and long-term exposure to {PM2.5} and hospitalization for all of the outcomes examined. In example, for respiratory diseases, for every10-����g/m3 increase in short-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 0.70 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������0.35 to 0.52) while concurrently for every10-����g/m3 increase in long-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 4.22 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������1.06 to {4.75).ConclusionsAs} with mortality studies, chronic exposure to particles is associated with substantially larger increases in hospital admissions than acute exposure and both can be detected simultaneously using our exposure models.},

  Abstract                 = {Although meteorological stations provide accurate air temperature observations, their spatial coverage is limited and thus often insufficient for epidemiological studies. Satellite data expand spatial coverage, enhancing our ability to estimate near surface air temperature (Ta). However, the derivation of Ta from surface temperature (Ts) measured by satellites is far from being straightforward. In this study, we present a novel approach that incorporates land use regression, meteorological variables and spatial smoothing to first calibrate between Ts and Ta on a daily basis and then predict Ta for days when satellite Ts data were not available. We applied mixed regression models with daily random slopes to calibrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} Ts data with monitored Ta measurements for 2003. Then, we used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate Ta in days with missing Ts. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample R2\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.946 and R2\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.941 respectively). Furthermore, based on the high quality predictions we investigated the spatial patterns of Ta within the study domain as they relate to urban vs. non-urban land uses.},

Complement factor C3c as marker for subclinical inflammation was measured at baseline. Individual exposure to traffic-related particulate matter ({PM)} and nitrogen dioxide was determined at different spatial scales. {RESULTS:} Between 1990 and 2006, 87 (10.5\%) new cases of diabetes were reported among the {SALIA} cohort members. The hazards for diabetes were increased by 15-42\% per interquartile range of {PM} or traffic-related exposure. The associations persisted when different spatial scales were used to assess exposure and remained robust after adjusting for age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, and exposure to several non-traffic-related sources of air pollution. C3c was associated with {PM} pollution at baseline and was a strong independent predictor of incident diabetes. Exploratory analyses indicated that women with high C3c blood levels were more susceptible for {PM-related} excess risk of diabetes than were women with low C3c levels. {CONCLUSIONS:} Traffic-related air pollution is associated with incident type 2 diabetes among elderly women. Subclinical inflammation may be a mechanism linking air pollution with type 2 {diabetes.Relevance} to clinical practice: Our study identifies traffic-related air pollution as a novel and potentially modifiable risk factor of type 2 diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {We conducted an extended follow-up and spatial analysis of the American Cancer Society ({ACS)} Cancer Prevention Study {II} ({CPS-II)} cohort in order to further examine associations between long-term exposure to particulate air pollution and mortality in large {U.S.} cities. The current study sought to clarify outstanding scientific issues that arose from our earlier {HEI-sponsored} Reanalysis of the original {ACS} study data (the Particle Epidemiology Reanalysis Project). Specifically, we examined (1) how ecologic covariates at the community and neighborhood levels might confound and modify the air pollution-mortality association; (2) how spatial autocorrelation and multiple levels of data (e.g., individual and neighborhood) can be taken into account within the random effects Cox model; (3) how using land-use regression to refine measurements of air pollution exposure to the within-city (or intra-urban) scale might affect the size and significance of health effects in the Los Angeles and New York City regions; and (4) what exposure time windows may be most critical to the air pollution-mortality association. The 18 years of follow-up (extended from 7 years in the original study [Pope et al. 1995]) included vital status data for the {CPS-II} cohort (approximately 1.2 million participants) with multiple cause-of-death codes through December 31, 2000 and more recent exposure data from air pollution monitoring sites for the metropolitan areas. In the Nationwide Analysis, the influence of ecologic covariate data (such as education attainment, housing characteristics, and level of income; data obtained from the 1980 {U.S.} Census; see Ecologic Covariates sidebar on page 14) on the air pollution-mortality association were examined at the Zip Code area ({ZCA)} scale, the metropolitan statistical area ({MSA)} scale, and by the difference between each {ZCA} value and the {MSA} value ({DIFF).} In contrast to previous analyses that did not directly include ecologic covariates at the {ZCA} scale, risk estimates increased when ecologic covariates were included at all scales. The ecologic covariates exerted their greatest effect on mortality from ischemic heart disease ({IHD)}, which was also the health outcome most strongly related with exposure to {PM2.5} (particles 2.5 microm or smaller in aerodynamic diameter), sulfate ({SO4(2-))}, and sulfur dioxide ({SO2)}, and the only outcome significantly associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide ({NO2).} When ecologic covariates were simultaneously included at both the {MSA} and {DIFF} levels, the hazard ratio ({HR)} for mortality from {IHD} associated with {PM2.5} exposure (average concentration for 1999-2000) increased by 7.5\% and that associated with {SO4(2-)} exposure (average concentration for 1990) increased by 12.8\%. The two covariates found to exert the greatest confounding influence on the {PM2.5-mortality} association were the percentage of the population with a grade 12 education and the median household income. Also in the Nationwide Analysis, complex spatial patterns in the {CPS-II} data were explored with an extended random effects Cox model (see Glossary of Statistical Terms at end of report) that is capable of clustering up to two geographic levels of data. Using this model tended to increase the {HR} estimate for exposure to air pollution and also to inflate the uncertainty in the estimates. Including ecologic covariates decreased the variance of the results at both the {MSA} and {ZCA} scales; the largest decrease was in residual variation based on models in which the {MSA} and {DIFF} levels of data were included together, which suggests that partitioning the ecologic covariates into between-{MSA} and within-{MSA} values more completely captures the sources of variation in the relationship between air pollution, ecologic covariates, and mortality. Intra-Urban Analyses were conducted for the New York City and Los Angeles regions. The results of the Los Angeles spatial analysis, where we found high exposure contrasts within the Los Angeles region, showed that air pollution-mortality risks were nearly 3 times greater than those reported from earlier analyses. This suggests that chronic health effects associated with intra-urban gradients in exposure to {PM2.5} may be even larger between {ZCAs} within an {MSA} than the associations between {MSAs} that have been previously reported. However, in the New York City spatial analysis, where we found very little exposure contrast between {ZCAs} within the New York region, mortality from all causes, cardiopulmonary disease ({CPD)}, and lung cancer was not elevated. A positive association was seen for {PM2.5} exposure and {IHD}, which provides evidence of a specific association with a cause of death that has high biologic plausibility. These results were robust when analyses controlled (1) the 44 individual-level covariates (from the {ACS} enrollment questionnaire in 1982; see 44 Individual-Level Covariates sidebar on page 22) and (2) spatial clustering using the random effects Cox model. Effects were mildly lower when unemployment at the {ZCA} scale was included. To examine whether there is a critical exposure time window that is primarily responsible for the increased mortality associated with ambient air pollution, we constructed individual time-dependent exposure profiles for particulate and gaseous air pollutants ({PM2.5} and {SO2)} for a subset of the {ACS} {CPS-II} participants for whom residence histories were available. The relevance of the three exposure time windows we considered was gauged using the magnitude of the relative risk ({HR)} of mortality as well as the Akaike information criterion ({AIC)}, which measures the goodness of fit of the model to the data. For {PM2.5}, no one exposure time window stood out as demonstrating the greatest {HR;} nor was there any clear pattern of a trend in {HR} going from recent to more distant windows or vice versa. Differences in {AIC} values among the three exposure time windows were also small. The {HRs} for mortality associated with exposure to {SO2} were highest in the most recent time window (1 to 5 years), although none of these {HRs} were significantly elevated. Identifying critical exposure time windows remains a challenge that warrants further work with other relevant data sets. This study provides additional support toward developing cost-effective air quality management policies and strategies. The epidemiologic results reported here are consistent with those from other population-based studies, which collectively have strongly supported the hypothesis that long-term exposure to {PM2.5} increases mortality in the general population. Future research using the extended Cox-Poisson random effects methods, advanced geostatistical modeling techniques, and newer exposure assessment techniques will provide additional insight.},

Analyses of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and all-cause and site-specific cancer incidence rates indicated that: 1) block group and tract socioeconomic measures performed comparably within and across both states, but zip code measures for several outcomes detected no gradients or gradients contrary to those observed with tract and block group measures; 2) similar gradients were detected with categories generated by quintiles and by a priori categorical cutpoints; and 3) measures including data on economic poverty were most robust and detected gradients that were unobserved using measures of only education and wealth.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews design and analysis concepts associated with the following major issues in air pollution epidemiology: (1) time-related determinants of health effects, including duration of exposure and disentangling acute effects and total life-shortening associated with long-term exposure; and (2) the role of geographies of susceptibility and exposure including the relevance and impact of ecologic covariates in the assessment of long-term effects of ambient air pollution. The article identifies the potential contribution associated with improved information in these areas to air pollution policy development and argues that these issues should frame future approaches to assessing the total effects of ambient air pollution.},

Multiresolution {AOD} from {MODIS} ({AODMODIS)} was compared with the in situ measurements of {AOD} by {NASA's} {AErosol} {RObotic} {NETwork} ({AERONET)} sunphotometer ({AODAERONET)} at Bondville, {IL}, to demonstrate the advantages of the fine resolution {AODMODIS} over the 10-km {AODMODIS}, especially for air quality prediction. An instrumental regression that corrects {AODMODIS} for meteorological conditions was used for developing a {PM} predictive model. The 2-km {AODMODIS} aggregated within 0.025���� and 15-min intervals shows the best association with the in situ measurements of {AODAERONET.} The 2-km {AODMODIS} seems more promising to estimate time and space resolved estimates of ambient {PM} than the 10-km {AODMODIS}, because of better location precision and a significantly greater number of data points across geographic space and time. Utilizing the collocated {AODMODIS} and {PM} data in Cleveland, {OH}, a regression model was developed for predicting {PM} for all {AODMODIS} data points. Our analysis suggests that the slope of the 2-km {AODMODIS} (instrumented on meteorological conditions) is close to unity with the {PM} monitored on the ground. These results should be interpreted with caution, because the slope of {AODMODIS} ranges from 0.52 to 1.72 in the site-specific models. In the cross validation of the overall model, the root mean square error ({RMSE)} of {PM10} was smaller (2.04 ����g/m3 in overall model) than that of {PM2.5} (2.5 ����g/m3). The predicted {PM} in the {AODMODIS} data (������2.34 million data points) was utilized to develop a systematic grid of daily {PM} at 5-km spatial resolution with the aid of spatiotemporal Kriging.},

  Abstract                 = {Prenatal traffic-related air pollution exposure is linked to adverse birth outcomes. However, modifying effects of maternal body mass index (BMI) and infant sex remain virtually unexplored.We examined whether associations between prenatal air pollution and birth weight differed by sex and maternal BMI in 670 urban ethnically mixed mother-child pairs.Black carbon (BC) levels were estimated using a validated spatio-temporal land-use regression (LUR) model; fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was estimated using a hybrid LUR model incorporating satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth measures. Using stratified multivariable-adjusted regression analyses, we examined whether associations between prenatal air pollution and calculated birth weight for gestational age (BWGA) z-scores varied by sex and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.Median birth weight was 3.3±0.6kg; 33\% of mothers were obese (BMI ≥30kg/m(3)). In stratified analyses, the association between higher PM2.5 and lower birth weight was significant in males of obese mothers (-0.42 unit of BWGA z-score change per IQR increase in PM2.5, 95\%CI: -0.79 to -0.06) ( PM2.5×sex×obesity Pinteraction=0.02). Results were similar for BC models (Pinteraction=0.002).Associations of prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution and reduced birth weight were most evident in males born to obese mothers.},

They were shown to be a unique subpopulation of T cells expanding during human and murine pregnancy. The importance of Treg for a normal pregnancy situation was proven by studies showing that their absence impairs murine pregnancy while the adoptive transfer of Treg prevents fetal rejection. In humans, pregnancy pathologies are associated with lower Treg frequencies while therapies that improve pregnancy outcome are able to boost their number. Functional studies have shown that Treg can regulate immune cell responses directly at the fetal������maternal interface either by interacting with other cells or by inducing the expression of immune regulatory molecules.

While several studies have suggested that high levels of air pollution or exposure to particular climatic factors may be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, other studies do not support such an association. To determine whether exposure to various environmental factors place a large London-based population at higher risk for preterm birth, we analyzed 482,568 births that occurred between 1988 and 2000 from the St. Mary's Maternity Information System database. Using an ecological study design, any short-term associations between preterm birth and various environmental factors were investigated using time-series regression techniques. Environmental exposures included air pollution (ambient ozone and {PM(10))} and climatic factors (temperature, rainfall, sunshine, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and largest drop in barometric pressure). In addition to exposure on the day of birth, cumulative exposure up to 1 week before birth was investigated. The risk of preterm birth did not increase with exposure to the levels of ambient air pollution or meteorological factors experienced by this population. Cumulative exposure from 0 to 6 days before birth also did not show any significant effect on the risk of preterm birth. This large study, covering 13 years, suggests that there is no association between preterm births and recent exposure to ambient air pollution or recent changes in the weather.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Epidemiologic studies have reported associations between fine particles (aerodynamic diameter ������ 2.5 ����m; {PM2.5)} and mortality. However, concerns have been raised regarding the sensitivity of the results to model specifications, lower exposures, and averaging time., Objective: We addressed these issues using 11 additional years of follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities study, incorporating recent lower exposures., Methods: We replicated the previously applied Cox regression, and examined different time lags, the shape of the concentration������response relationship using penalized splines, and changes in the slope of the relation over time. We then conducted Poisson survival analysis with time-varying effects for smoking, sex, and education., Results: Since 2001, average {PM2.5} levels, for all six cities, were {\textless} 18 ����g/m3. Each increase in {PM2.5} (10 ����g/m3) was associated with an adjusted increased risk of all-cause mortality ({PM2.5} average on previous year) of 14\% [95\% confidence interval ({CI):} 7, 22], and with 26\% (95\% {CI:} 14, 40) and 37\% (95\% {CI:} 7, 75) increases in cardiovascular and lung-cancer mortality ({PM2.5} average of three previous years), respectively. The concentration������response relationship was linear down to {PM2.5} concentrations of 8 ����g/m3. Mortality rate ratios for {PM2.5} fluctuated over time, but without clear trends despite a substantial drop in the sulfate fraction. Poisson models produced similar results., Conclusions: These results suggest that further public policy efforts that reduce fine particulate matter air pollution are likely to have continuing public health benefits.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} A heatwave occurred in France in August 2003, with an accompanying excess of all-cause mortality. This study quantifies this excess mortality and investigates a possible harvesting effect in the few weeks after the heatwave. {METHODS:} A time-series study using a Poisson regression model with regression splines to control for nonlinear confounders was used to analyze the correlation between heatwave variable and mortality in 9 French cities. {RESULTS:} After controlling for long-term and seasonal time trends and the usual effects of temperature and air pollution, we estimated that 3,096 extra deaths resulted from the heatwave. The maximum daily relative risk of mortality during the heatwave (compared with expected deaths at that time of year) ranged from 1.16 in Le Havre to 5.00 in Paris. There was little evidence of mortality displacement in the few weeks after the heatwave, with an estimated deficit of 253 deaths at the end of the period. {CONCLUSIONS:} The heatwave in France during August 2003 was associated with a large increase in the number of deaths. The impact estimated using a time-series design was consistent with crude previous estimates of the impact of the heatwave. This finding suggests that neither air pollution nor long-term and seasonal trends confounded previous estimates. There was no evidence to suggest that the extras deaths associated with the heatwave were simply brought forward in time.},

  Abstract                 = {In evaluating risks from air pollution, health impact assessments often focus on the magnitude of the impacts without explicitly considering the distribution of impacts across subpopulations. In this study, we constructed a model to estimate the magnitude and distribution of health benefits associated with emission controls at five older power plants in the Washington, {DC}, area. We used the {CALPUFF} atmospheric dispersion model to determine the primary and secondary fine-particulate-matter ({\textless} 2.5 micro m in aerodynamic diameter) concentration reductions associated with the hypothetical application of {"Best} Available Control Technology" to the selected power plants. We combined these concentration reductions with concentration-response functions for mortality and selected morbidity outcomes, using a conventional approach as well as considering susceptible subpopulations. Incorporating susceptibility had a minimal effect on total benefits, with central estimates of approximately 240 fewer premature deaths, 60 fewer cardiovascular hospital admissions ({CHA)}, and 160 fewer pediatric asthma emergency room visits ({ERV)} per year. However, because individuals with lower education appear to have both higher background mortality rates and higher relative risks for air-pollution-related mortality, stratifying by educational attainment implies that 51\% of the mortality benefits accrue among the 25\% of the population with less than high school education. Similarly, diabetics and African Americans bear disproportionate shares of the {CHA} and {ERV} benefits, respectively. Although our ability to characterize subpopulations is constrained by the available information, our analysis demonstrates that incorporation of susceptibility information significantly affects demographic and geographic patterns of health benefits and enhances our understanding of individuals likely to benefit from emission controls.},

Methods A case������control study, nested within a cohort of 44,835 nurses educated between 1914 and 1980 was performed, based on a registry of all Norwegian nurses. Four controls were individually matched by year of birth to each of 537 breast cancer cases that occurred during the period 1960������1982. The reconstruction of work history and number of years with night work for each nurse was based on information from the nurse registry, and data from three censuses. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios ({ORs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)}, adjusted for total duration of work as a nurse and parity. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results The adjusted {OR} of breast cancer among nurses who worked nights for 30 or more years was 2.21 ({CI} 1.10������4.45) compared with those who did not work nights after graduation from nursing school (ptrend = 0.01). Conclusion Our results are in accordance with previous studies that find an association between night work and breast cancer risk among women.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Understanding the relationship between socioeconomic status ({SES)} and prostate cancer incidence could identify populations that should be targeted for intervention and prevention programs. We examined this relationship within the major racial/ethnic groups during the period 1972 through 1997, which spans the introduction of prostate-specific antigen ({PSA)} testing. Methods: We used data from the population-based Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program to examine age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates in five {SES} groups over three specific calendar periods by racial/ethnic subpopulation (white, black, Asian, and Hispanic) and by stage of disease at diagnosis. Linear regression analysis was used to test for trends in the age-adjusted incidence rates that were associated with increasing levels of {SES.} All P values were two-sided. Results: For men diagnosed with prostate cancer before 1987, when the test for {PSA} was not widely available, we found no association between {SES} and the incidence of prostate cancer in any of four racial/ethnic subpopulations or between {SES} and the stage of disease at diagnosis. In contrast, among men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer after 1987, {SES} was statistically significantly and positively associated with prostate cancer incidence in men from all racial/ethnic subpopulations except Asians (P = .01 for white men, P = .001 for black men, P = .02 for Hispanic men, P = .06 for Asian men, and P = .01 for all men combined). Higher {SES} was statistically significantly associated with cancers of earlier stage (P = .01 for localized cancer and P = .00 for regional cancer) for men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer after 1987. Conclusions: The association between {SES} and prostate cancer incidence after 1987 may reflect more prevalent {PSA} screening in populations with higher {SES} due to their greater access to health care. {SES} should, therefore, be considered an important factor in interpreting variations and time trends in prostate cancer incidence.},

We repeated this procedure for 7 weeks on each subject. We tested the associations using mixed-effects models. {RESULTS:} {PM10} was significantly positively associated with {FMD} and {TBARS} but inversely associated with end-systolic basal brachial arterial diameter (P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, in subjects not taking vasoactive medications, {PM10} was significantly positively associated with blood pressure but inversely associated with artery flow. {CONCLUSION:} Elevated {PM10} may contribute to oxidative stress and impaired cardiovascular function in patients with diabetes mellitus.},

Multiple logistic regression was undertaken to compare socio-demographic characteristics by histology. Progression from in situ disease was investigated using the Kaplan-Meier method. {RESULTS:} The incidence of in situ lesions increased approximately seven-fold over the 20-year period, compared with an increase of about 40\% for invasive cancers. The increase for in situ lesions was due to increases for ductal carcinomas, with little change for lobular lesions. By comparison, the percentage increase in incidence for invasive cancer was greater for lobular than ductal cancers. Both for in situ and invasive cancers, percentage increases were greatest for the screening target age range of 50-69 years. One in 14 in situ cases was found to progress to invasive cancer within seven years of diagnosis, but insufficient detail was available to determine whether the invasive cancers were a progression of the in situ lesions or whether they originated separately. These invasive cancers were smaller than generally applying for other invasive cancers of the female breast. {CONCLUSIONS:} The larger secular increases in incidence for in situ than invasive cancers would reflect the dominant role of mammography in the detection of ductal carcinoma in situ. The lack of an increase for lobular in situ lesions may have resulted from their poorer radiological visibility. The greater percentage increase for lobular than ductal invasive lesions may have been due to an increase in imaging sensitivity for these lesions, plus real increases in incidence. The smaller sizes of invasive cancers found in women with a prior in situ diagnosis may have resulted from more intensive medical surveillance, although the possibility of biological differences cannot be discounted.},

  Note                     = {Geographic Information Systems ({GIS)} have been used increasingly to map instances of environmental injustice, the disproportionate exposure of certain populations to environmental hazards. Some of the technical and analytic difficulties of mapping environmental injustice are outlined in this article, along with suggestions for using {GIS} to better assess and predict environmental health and equity. I examine 13 {GIS-based} environmental equity studies conducted within the past decade and use a study of noxious land use locations in the Bronx, New York, to illustrate and evaluate the differences in two common methods of determining exposure extent and the characteristics of proximate populations. Unresolved issues in mapping environmental equity and health include lack of comprehensive hazards databases; the inadequacy of current exposure indices; the need to develop realistic methodologies for determining the geographic extent of exposure and the characteristics of the affected populations; and the paucity and insufficiency of health assessment data. {GIS} have great potential to help us understand the spatial relationship between pollution and health. Refinements in exposure indices; the use of dispersion modeling and advanced proximity analysis; the application of neighborhood-scale analysis; and the consideration of other factors such as zoning and planning policies will enable more conclusive findings. The environmental equity studies reviewed in this article found a disproportionate environmental burden based on race and/or income. It is critical now to demonstrate correspondence between environmental burdens and adverse health impacts-to show the disproportionate effects of pollution rather than just the disproportionate distribution of pollution sources.},

African American ethnicity, increased age, aggressive histology, poor tumor grade, and advanced-stage disease were associated with increased risk for death; higher income and hysterectomy were associated with decreased risk for death. Conclusions. Lower income was associated with advanced-stage disease, lower likelihood of receiving a hysterectomy, and lower rates of survival. Earlier diagnosis and removal of barriers to optimal treatment among lower-socioeconomic status women will diminish racial/ethnic differences in endometrial cancer survival.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVES:} Particulate matter has been associated with acute cardiovascular outcomes, but our understanding of the mechanism is incomplete. We examined the association between particulate matter and cell adhesion molecules. We also investigated the modifying effect of genotype and phenotype variation to gain insight into the relevant biological pathways for this association. {METHODS:} We used mixed regression models to examine the association of {PM(2.5)} (particulate matter {\textless} or = 2.5 microm in diameter) and black carbon with serum concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule ({sICAM-1)} and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule ({sVCAM-1)}, markers of endothelial function and inflammation, in a longitudinal study of 809 participants in the Normative Ageing Study (1819 total observations). We also examined whether this association was modified by genotype, obesity or diabetes status. Genes selected for analyses were either related to oxidative stress, endothelial function, lipid metabolism or metal processing. {RESULTS:} Black carbon during the 2 days prior to blood draw was significantly associated with increased {sVCAM-1} (4.5\% increase per 1 microg/m(3), 95\% {CI} 1.1 to 8.0). Neither pollutant was associated with {sICAM-1.} Larger effects of black carbon on {sVCAM} were seen in subjects with obesity (p=0.007) and who were {GSTM1} null (p=0.02). {CONCLUSIONS:} Black carbon is associated with markers of endothelial function and inflammation. Genes related to oxidative defence may modify this association.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Geographical variation in mortality is influenced by factors operating in early life and in adulthood. The relative contributions of these factors may be examined by comparing the extent to which adult mortality is related to places of residence in early life and at death. We describe a population-based case-control design, in which all deaths are used as cases and the Office for National Statistics ({ONS)} Longitudinal Study ({LS)} survivors are used as controls. Methods Cases were all deaths from stomach cancer and stroke in England and Wales 1993-1995 amongst people born between January 1930 and September 1939 and for whom place of enumeration in 1939 could be imputed from the first three characters of their National Health Service number. Controls were all {LS} members born in the same period, enumerated in the 1991 census, resident in England and Wales in mid-1994 and for whom place of enumeration in 1939 could be similarly imputed. Logistic regression was used, adjusting for birth year, sex and social class. A previous mapping exercise by {ONS} generated comparable geographical units (counties) for 1939 enumeration and area of residence in 1991 or at death. Non-migrant' (i.e. 1939 county' the same as county in 1991 or at death) case:control ratios were calculated to indicate background mortality risk in counties, with adjustment for imprecision using Bayesian smoothing methods. These ratios were then used in modelling risk for inter-county migrants. Results There were 2590 stomach cancer and 7778 stroke deaths and 28 400 men and28 180 women as controls. For men, 64\%, 61\% and 67\% of stomach cancer deaths, stroke deaths and controls respectively could be assigned a county of enumeration in 1939. The corresponding percentages for women were 76\%, 72\% and 75\%. For stomach cancer, after adjustment for county of enumeration in 1939, a significant association with the non-migrant case:control ratio for county of residence in 1991 or at death was observed (P= 0.010), indicating an association between current area of residence and stomach cancer mortality. There was no evidence of an independent effect of county of enumeration in 1939. For stroke, there was a highly significant trend in relation to 1939 county (P = 0.0004)and a less significant association with county of residence in 1991 or at death(P = 0.016). Conclusions The method described is able to detect the effect of place of residence in early life on geographical variation in adult mortality and will be useful for investigating specific characteristics of areas of enumeration in 1939 in relation to subsequent risk of mortality from a range of diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Fine particulate air pollution has been linked to cardiovascular disease, but previous studies have assessed only mortality and differences in exposure between cities. We examined the association of long-term exposure to particulate matter of less than 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ({PM2.5)} with cardiovascular events. {METHODS:} We studied 65,893 postmenopausal women without previous cardiovascular disease in 36 {U.S.} metropolitan areas from 1994 to 1998, with a median follow-up of 6 years. We assessed the women's exposure to air pollutants using the monitor located nearest to each woman's residence. Hazard ratios were estimated for the first cardiovascular event, adjusting for age, race or ethnic group, smoking status, educational level, household income, body-mass index, and presence or absence of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia. {RESULTS:} A total of 1816 women had one or more fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events, as confirmed by a review of medical records, including death from coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In 2000, levels of {PM2.5} exposure varied from 3.4 to 28.3 microg per cubic meter (mean, 13.5). Each increase of 10 microg per cubic meter was associated with a 24\% increase in the risk of a cardiovascular event (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 1.09 to 1.41) and a 76\% increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95\% {CI}, 1.25 to 2.47). For cardiovascular events, the between-city effect appeared to be smaller than the within-city effect. The risk of cerebrovascular events was also associated with increased levels of {PM2.5} (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95\% {CI}, 1.08 to 1.68). {CONCLUSIONS:} Long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution is associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease and death among postmenopausal women. Exposure differences within cities are associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Organisms must adapt to the temporal characteristics of their surroundings to successfully survive and reproduce. Variation in the daily light cycle, for example, acts through endocrine and neurobiological mechanisms to control several downstream physiological and behavioral processes. Interruptions in normal circadian light cycles and the resulting disruption of normal melatonin rhythms cause widespread disruptive effects involving multiple body systems, the results of which can have serious medical consequences for individuals, as well as large-scale ecological implications for populations. With the invention of electrical lights about a century ago, the temporal organization of the environment has been drastically altered for many species, including humans. In addition to the incidental exposure to light at night through light pollution, humans also engage in increasing amounts of shift-work, resulting in repeated and often long-term circadian disruption. The increasing prevalence of exposure to light at night has significant social, ecological, behavioral, and health consequences that are only now becoming apparent. This review addresses the complicated web of potential behavioral and physiological consequences resulting from exposure to light at night, as well as the large-scale medical and ecological implications that may result.},

  Abstract                 = {Winter is a particularly difficult time to breed and survive. Animals monitor day length (photoperiod) to engage seasonally appropriate adaptations in anticipation of harsh winter conditions. I propose that photoperiodic information, mediated by melatonin, might also influence immune responses. Individuals could improve survival if seasonally recurring stressors were anticipated and countered. Recent studies suggest that short day lengths reroute energy from reproduction and growth to bolster immune function during winter. Short days can either enhance or suppress components of immune function, as well as reduce fever and the expression of sickness behaviors. The net result of these photoperiod-mediated adjustments is enhanced immune function and increased survival. Melatonin appears to be part of an integrated system that coordinates reproductive, immunological and other processes to cope successfully with energetic stressors during winter and to balance trade-offs between reproductive success and survival.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traditional air pollution epidemiology studies being conducted in large cities can be limited by the availability of monitoring. Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements offer the possibility of exposure estimates for the entire population. We previously demonstrated that daily calibration substantially increased the predictive power of satellite {AOD} measurements for fine particles ({PM2.5)} in New England, allowing estimation of exposure in locations without monitors. Similar results have not been reported for larger particles ({PM10)}, which are often the only measures that can be used in locations worldwide that do not have comprehensive {PM2.5} monitoring; this also applies to {PM} estimation of historical exposures. Here we extend this methodology by applying it to 2000������2009 {PM10} data from Lombardy, Northern Italy a region with high altitude differences, frequent temperature inversions and stationary fronts. Specifically, by 1) incorporating a model for missing {AOD} data to deal with non-randomness in the missing data; and 2) modeling interactions between land use and meteorological parameters to better capture space������time interactions. We calibrated {AOD} data through mixed-effect models regressing {PM10} measurements using day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random {AOD} and temperature slopes. We used inverse-probability weighting to account for nonrandom {AOD} missingness, while reducing the dimensionality of spatial and temporal predictors and avoiding selecting different predictors in different locations, as common in land-use regression. We take advantage of associations of grid-cell {AOD} values with {PM10} monitoring located elsewhere and with {AOD} values in neighboring grid cells to develop grid-cell predictions when {AOD} is missing. By using ten-fold cross-validation to test the accuracy of our predictions, we found high out-of-sample R2 (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.738������0.818) for days with available {AOD} data. Even in days with no available {AOD}, our model performance was comparable (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.736������0.841). Our results demonstrate that {PM10} can be reliably predicted using this {AOD-based} prediction model, even in a geographical area with complex geographic and weather patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Land-use regression models ({LUR)} estimate outdoor air pollution at high spatial resolution. Previous {LURs} have generally focused on individual cities. Here, we present an {LUR} for year-2006 ground-level {NO2} concentrations throughout the contiguous United States. Our approach employs ground- and satellite-based {NO2} measurements, and geographic characteristics such as population density, land-use (based on satellite data), and distance to major and minor roads. The results provide reliable estimates of ambient {NO2} air pollution as measured by the {U.S.} {EPA} (R2 = 0.78; bias = 22\%) at a spatial resolution (?30 m) that is capable of capturing within-urban and near-roadway gradients in {NO2.} We explore several aspects of temporal (time-of-day; day-of-week; season) and spatial (urban versus rural; {U.S.} region) variability in the model. Results are robust to spatial autocorrelation, to selection of an alternative input data set, and to minor perturbations in input data (using 90\% of the data to predict the remaining 10\%). The modeled population-weighted (unweighted) mean outdoor concentration in the United States is 10.7 (4.8) ppb. Our approach could be implemented in other areas of the world given sufficient road network and pollutant monitoring data. To facilitate future use and evaluation of the results, concentration estimates for the ?8 million {U.S.} Census blocks in the contiguous United States are publicly available via the Supporting Information.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Short-term changes in levels of fine ambient particulate matter ({PM2.5)} may increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke; however, results from prior studies have been inconsistent. We examined this hypothesis using data from a multicenter prospective stroke registry. {METHODS:} We analyzed data from 9202 patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke, having a documented date and time of stroke onset, and residing within 50 km of a {PM2.5} monitor in 8 cities in Ontario, Canada. We evaluated the risk of ischemic stroke onset associated with {PM2.5} in each city using a time-stratified case-crossover design, matching on day of week and time of day. We then combined these city-specific estimates using random-effects meta-analysis techniques. We examined whether the effects of {PM2.5} differed across strata defined by patient characteristics and ischemic stroke etiology. {RESULTS:} Overall, {PM2.5} was associated with a -0.7\% change in ischemic stroke risk per 10-mug/m increase in {PM2.5} (95\% confidence interval = -6.3\% to 5.1\%). These overall negative results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. Among patients with diabetes mellitus, {PM2.5} was associated with an 11\% increase in ischemic stroke risk (1\% to 22\%). The association between {PM2.5} and ischemic stroke risk varied according to stroke etiology, with the strongest associations observed for strokes due to large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel occlusion. {CONCLUSIONS:} These results do not support the hypothesis that short-term increases in {PM2.5} levels are associated with ischemic stroke risk overall. However, specific patient subgroups may be at increased risk of particulate-related ischemic strokes.},

  Abstract                 = {We conducted a nested case-control study of women in the New York State cohort who lived on Long Island. We estimated the historical environmental exposure to pesticides in 105 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1980 and 1992 and 210 age and race-matched controls in this cohort of long-term residentially stable women who completed a short mailed questionnaire in 1980. Prior agricultural land use was assessed from aerial photographs taken in 1947 and 1950. Pesticides detected in drinking water were estimated from measures taken between 1977 and 1992. Geographic information system software was used to calculate the distance between residences and hazardous waste sites ({HWS)} containing pesticides. We found an increased breast cancer risk for women residing within 1 mile of {HWS} containing organochlorine pesticides (odds ratio [{OR]=2.8;} 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 1.1-7.1), after adjusting for other risk factors. A significant interaction was shown for women residing on land that was previously used for agriculture and women who were either nulliparous or had an older age at first birth ([greater-or-equal, slanted]26������yr old), compared to women who did not live on previously agricultural land and with a younger age ({\textless}26������yr old) at first birth ({OR=6.4;} {95\%CI}, 2.2-18.2).

Our findings suggest that exposure to pesticides in the environment needs to be more comprehensively investigated in relation to breast cancer risk.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Epidemiological studies suggest that people with diabetes are vulnerable to cardiovascular health effects associated with exposure to particle air pollution. Endothelial and vascular function is impaired in diabetes and may be related to increased cardiovascular risk. We examined whether endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular reactivity was associated with particle exposure in individuals with and without diabetes. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS:} Study subjects were 270 greater-Boston residents. We measured 24-hour average ambient levels of air pollution (fine particles [{PM2.5]}, particle number, black carbon, and sulfates [{SO4(2-)])} approximately 500 m from the patient examination site. Pollutant concentrations were evaluated for associations with vascular reactivity. Linear regressions were fit to the percent change in brachial artery diameter (flow mediated and nitroglycerin mediated), with the particulate pollutant index, apparent temperature, season, age, race, sex, smoking history, and body mass index as predictors. Models were fit to all subjects and then stratified by diagnosed diabetes versus at risk for diabetes. Six-day moving averages of all 4 particle metrics were associated with decreased vascular reactivity among patients with diabetes but not those at risk. Interquartile range increases in {SO4(2-)} were associated with decreased flow-mediated (-10.7\%; 95\% {CI}, -17.3 to -3.5) and nitroglycerin-mediated (-5.4\%; 95\% {CI}, -10.5 to -0.1) vascular reactivity among those with diabetes. Black carbon increases were associated with decreased flow-mediated vascular reactivity (-12.6\%; 95\% {CI}, -21.7 to -2.4), and {PM2.5} was associated with nitroglycerin-mediated reactivity (-7.6\%; 95\% {CI}, -12.8 to -2.1). Effects were stronger in type {II} than type I diabetes. {CONCLUSIONS:} Diabetes confers vulnerability to particles associated with coal-burning power plants and traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {Many epidemiologic studies provide evidence of an association between daily counts of mortality and ambient particulate matter{\textless}10 microm in diameter ({PM10).} Relatively few studies, however, have investigated the relationship of mortality with fine particles [{PM{\textless}2.5} microm in diameter ({PM2.5)]}, especially in a multicity setting. We examined associations between {PM2.5} and daily mortality in nine heavily populated California counties using data from 1999 through 2002. We considered daily counts of all-cause mortality and several cause-specific subcategories (respiratory, cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes). We also examined these associations among several subpopulations, including the elderly ({\textgreater}65 years of age), males, females, non-high school graduates, whites, and Hispanics. We used Poisson multiple regression models incorporating natural or penalized splines to control for covariates that could affect daily counts of mortality, including time, seasonality, temperature, humidity, and day of the week. We used meta-analyses using random-effects models to pool the observations in all nine counties. The analysis revealed associations of {PM2.5} levels with several mortality categories. Specifically, a 10-microg/m3 change in 2-day average {PM2.5} concentration corresponded to a 0.6\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.2-1.0\%) increase in all-cause mortality, with similar or greater effect estimates for several other subpopulations and mortality subcategories, including respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, age{\textgreater}65 years, females, deaths out of the hospital, and non-high school graduates. Results were generally insensitive to model specification and the type of spline model used. This analysis adds to the growing body of evidence linking {PM2.5} with daily mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE:} As a result of the California heat wave in July 2006, county coroners reported that the high temperatures during that period caused approximately 147 deaths. However, heat wave-related deaths are likely to be underreported due to a lack of a clear case definition and the multi-factorial nature of heat-related mortality. Public health policy suggests a need for a careful assessment of mortality following a heat wave. In addition, it is useful to provide a comparison of the mortality impact per degree change during heat waves versus high temperatures observed during non-heat wave periods. {DESIGN:} Daily data were collected for mortality, weather and ozone in seven California counties impacted by the July 2006 heat wave. The association between apparent temperature and daily mortality was assessed using a Poisson regression model and combined across counties in a meta-analysis. These results were then used to estimate the increases in the number of deaths during the heat wave. {RESULTS:} Our analysis indicated that during the July heat wave, there was a 9\% (95\% {CI} = 1.6, 16.3) increase in daily mortality per 10 degrees Fahrenheit (F) change in apparent temperature for all counties combined. This estimate is almost 3 times larger than the effect estimated for the full warm season of May-September, during the non-heat wave years. Our estimates also determined that actual mortality during the July 2006 heat wave was 2-3 times greater than the coroner estimates. {CONCLUSION:} This multi-county analysis provides additional evidence that the attributable risk of mortality following a heat wave may be underestimated by examining only direct heat-related deaths. In addition, we have found that the mortality effect per degrees F is several times higher than that reported during non-heat wave periods.},

  Abstract                 = {{RATIONALE:} Acute and chronic exposures to airborne particulate matter ({PM)} have been linked in epidemiological studies to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular disorders that are characterized by a dysfunctional endothelium. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. {OBJECTIVE:} To examine whether exposure to fine {PM} with an aerodynamic diameter of {\textless}2.5 microm ({PM(2.5))} affects the circulating levels of endothelial progenitor cell ({EPC)} populations, systemic inflammation and coagulation. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS:} Phenotypically distinct {EPC} populations were quantified by flow cytometry in young (18 to 25 years) adult humans exposed to episodic increases in {PM(2.5)} along the Wasatch Mountain Front in Utah. In addition, Sca-{1+/Flk-1+} cells were measured in the peripheral blood of mice exposed to concentrated particles from ambient air in Louisville, Ky. In both studies, {PM} exposure was negatively correlated with circulating {EPC} levels. In humans, statistically significant associations between {PM(2.5)} exposure and the plasma levels of platelet-monocyte aggregates, high-density lipoprotein, and nonalbumin protein were also observed. Episodic increases in {PM(2.5)} did not change plasma levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, or serum amyloid A. {CONCLUSIONS:} Episodic exposure to {PM(2.5)} induces reversible vascular injury, reflected in part by depletion of circulating {EPC} levels, and increases in platelet activation and the plasma level of high-density lipoprotein. These changes were also accompanied by an increase in nonalbumin protein and may be related to mechanisms by which exposure to particulate air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and adverse cardiovascular events.},

In a large case-control study with a complete study base, we investigated whether hospital admissions for ischemic stroke were associated with residential concentrations of outdoor {NOx}, as a proxy for exposure to air pollution, in the region of Scania, Southern Sweden. {METHODS:} We used a two-phase case-control study design, including as first-phase controls all individuals born between 1923 and 1965 and residing in Scania in 2002 (N = 556 912). We defined first-phase cases as first-time ischemic stroke patients residing in Scania and registered in the Swedish stroke register between 2001 and 2005 (N = 4 904) and second-phase cases as cases for whom we had information on smoking status, diabetes, and medication for hypertension (N = 4 375). For the controls, information on these covariables was collected from a public health survey, resulting in 4 716 second-phase controls. With a geographical information system and an emission database, individual residential outdoor annual mean {NOx} concentration was modelled. The data were analyzed with logistic regression. {RESULTS:} We found no evident association between {NOx} and ischemic stroke. For example, the odds ratio for ischemic stroke associated with the {NOx} category 20-30 microg/m3 compared to the reference category of {\textless}10 microg/m3 was 0.95 (95\% {CI} 0.86-1.06). {CONCLUSION:} In this study area, with generally low levels of air pollution, using a complete study base, high-quality ascertainment of cases, and individually modelled exposure, we did not observe any clear association between {NOx} and ischemic stroke hospital admissions.},

We apply these statistics to analyze breast cancer data from the Upper Cape Cancer Incidence Study using three different latency {assumptions.RESULTS:The} three different latency assumptions produced three different spatial patterns of cases and controls. For 20 year latency, all three methods generally concur. However, for 15 year latency and no latency assumptions, the methods produce different results when testing for global {clustering.CONCLUSION:The} comparative analyses of real data sets by different statistical methods provides insight into directions for further research. We suggest a research program designed around examining real data sets to guide focused investigation of relevant features using simulated data, for the purpose of understanding how to interpret statistical methods applied to epidemiological data with a spatial component.},

The study reveals the formation of day time ������cool island������ over central parts of Delhi which are found to be cooler by a maximum of {4������6\&\#xa0;����C} than the surrounding rural areas. During the night time, however, the central parts of Delhi are found to be warmer by a maximum of {4������7\&\#xa0;����C} or even more than the surrounding rural areas thus confirming the formation of nocturnal urban heat island over Delhi. Measurements of solar spectral irradiance over Delhi reveal significantly lower values as compared to a rural site located south-west of Delhi, during the low wind conditions in the months of November and December. Analysis of average monthly temporal data of surface wind speed and particulate matter concentration over Delhi reveals a strong anti-correlation between wind speed and particulate matter concentration. High values of particulate matter during low wind conditions seem to favor the so called ������cool island������ over Delhi. Analysis of radiosonde data of {975\&\#xa0;hPa} and {850\&\#xa0;hPa} temperatures over Delhi during November and December from 1973 to 2010 reveals a warming trend at the {850\&\#xa0;hPa} level and an overall declining trend of {������T} between {975\&\#xa0;hPa} temperatures and {850\&\#xa0;hPa} temperatures, thus indicating a weakening of vertical thermal gradients over Delhi during these months.

We examined 4-hr, 24-hr, and 48-hr moving averages of air pollution ({PM2.5}, particle number concentration, black carbon, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide). Controlling for potential confounders, {HF} decreased 20.8\% [95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 4.6-34.2\%] and {LF:HF} ratio increased 18.6\% (95\% {CI}, 4.1-35.2\%) per {SD} (8 microg/m3) increase in 48-hr {PM2.5.} {LF} was reduced by 11.5\% (95\% {CI}, 0.4-21.3\%) per {SD} (13 ppb) increment in 4-hr O3. The associations between {HRV} and {PM2.5} and O3 were stronger in people with ischemic heart disease ({IHD)} and hypertension. The associations observed between {SDNN} and {LF} and {PM2.5} were stronger in people with diabetes. People using calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers had lower associations between O3 and {PM2.5} with {LF.} No effect modification by other cardiac medications was found. Exposures to {PM2.5} and O3 are associated with decreased {HRV}, and history of {IHD}, hypertension, and diabetes may confer susceptibility to autonomic dysfunction by air pollution.},

The total number of new cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) was 8.1 million, just over half of which occur in the developing countries. The most common cancer in the world today is lung cancer, accounting for 18\% of cancers of men worldwide, and 21\% of cancers in men in the developed countries. Stomach cancer is second in frequency (almost 10\% of all new cancers) and breast cancer, by far the most common cancer among women (21\% of the total), is third. There are large differences in the relative frequency of different cancers by world area. The major cancers of developed countries (other than the 3 already named) are cancers of the colon-rectum and prostate, and in developing countries, cancers of the cervix uteri and esophagus. The implications of these patterns for cancer control, and specifically prevention, are discussed.

Overall, there were 10.9 million new cases, 6.7 million deaths, and 24.6 million persons alive with cancer (within three years of diagnosis). The most commonly diagnosed cancers are lung (1.35 million), breast (1.15 million), and colorectal (1 million); the most common causes of cancer death are lung cancer (1.18 million deaths), stomach cancer (700,000 deaths), and liver cancer (598,000 deaths). The most prevalent cancer in the world is breast cancer (4.4 million survivors up to 5 years following diagnosis). There are striking variations in the risk of different cancers by geographic area. Most of the international variation is due to exposure to known or suspected risk factors related to lifestyle or environment, and provides a clear challenge to prevention.},

Testicular function is temperature dependent, and in both man and mouse the position of the testes in the scrotum ensures that they are kept at between 2 and 8 {����C} below core body temperature.

We detected temperature-dependent changes in testicular architecture, number of apoptotic cells and a significant reduction in testis weight 7 and 14 days after heat stress at 42 {����C.} We report for the first time that {DNA} strand breaks (����-{H2AX-positive} foci) were present in spermatocytes recovered from testes subjected to 40 or 42 {����C.} Fertility of heat-stressed males was tested 23������28 d after treatment (sperm at this time would have been spermatocytes at time of heating). Paternal heat stress at 42 {����C} resulted in reduced pregnancy rate, placental weight and litter size; pregnancies from the 40 {����C} group had increased resorptions at e14.5. Abnormalities in embryonic development were detected at e3.5 and in vitro fertilisation with sperm recovered 16 h or 23 d after scrotal stress at 42 {����C} revealed a block in development between the 4-cell and blastocyst stages. This study has provided evidence of temperature-dependent effects on germ cell {DNA} integrity and highlighted the importance of an intact paternal genome for normal embryo development.},

However, the rise of modern epidemiology has been a mixed blessing, and the new paradigm has major shortcomings, both in public health and in scientific terms. The changes in the paradigm have not been neutral but have rather helped change--and have reflected changes in--the way in which epidemiologists think about health and disease. The key issue has been the shift in the level of analysis from the population to the individual. Epidemiology has largely ceased to function as part of a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the causation of disease in populations and has become a set of generic methods for measuring associations of exposure and disease in individuals. This reductionist approach focuses on the individual, blames the victim, and produces interventions that can be harmful. We seem to be using more and more advanced technology to study more and more trivial issues, while the major causes of disease are ignored. Epidemiology must reintegrate itself into public health and must rediscover the population perspective.},

The authors collected data on over 4 million emergency department visits from 31 hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia, between January 1993 and August 2000. Visits for cardiovascular disease were examined in relation to levels of ambient pollutants by use of a case-crossover framework. Heterogeneity of risk was examined for several comorbid conditions. The results included evidence of stronger associations of dysrhythmia and congestive heart failure visits with comorbid hypertension in relation to increased air pollution levels compared with visits without comorbid hypertension; similar evidence of effect modification by diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD)} was observed for dysrhythmia and peripheral and cerebrovascular disease visits, respectively. Evidence of effect modification by comorbid hypertension and diabetes was observed in relation to particulate matter less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, while evidence of effect modification by comorbid {COPD} was also observed in response to ozone levels. These findings provide further evidence of increased susceptibility to adverse cardiovascular events associated with ambient air pollution among persons with hypertension, diabetes, and {COPD.}},

  Abstract                 = {Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality and these patients, even without previous myocardial infarction, run the risk of fatal coronary heart disease similar to non-diabetic patients surviving myocardial infarction. There is evidence showing that particulate matter air pollution is associated with increases in cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of diabetes mellitus on the association of air pollution with cardiovascular emergency room visits in a tertiary referral hospital in the city of Sao Paulo. Using a time-series approach, and adopting generalized linear Poisson regression models, we assessed the effect of daily variations in {PM10}, {CO}, {NO2}, {SO2}, and O3 on the daily number of emergency room visits for cardiovascular diseases in diabetic and non-diabetic patients from 2001 to 2003. A semi-parametric smoother (natural spline) was adopted to control long-term trends, linear term seasonal usage and weather variables. In this period, 45,000 cardiovascular emergency room visits were registered. The observed increase in interquartile range within the 2-day moving average of 8.0 microg/m(3) {SO2} was associated with 7.0\% ({95\%CI:} 4.0-11.0) and 20.0\% ({95\%CI:} 5.0-44.0) increases in cardiovascular disease emergency room visits by non-diabetic and diabetic groups, respectively. These data indicate that air pollution causes an increase of cardiovascular emergency room visits, and that diabetic patients are extremely susceptible to the adverse effects of air pollution on their health conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Mounting evidence suggests habitual sleep duration is associated with various health outcomes; both short and long sleep duration have been implicated in increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and all-cause mortality. However, data on the relation between sleep duration and cancer risk are sparse and inconclusive. A link between low levels of melatonin, a hormone closely related to sleep, and increased risk of breast cancer has recently been suggested but it is unclear whether duration of sleep may affect breast cancer risk. We explored the association between habitual sleep duration reported in 1986 and subsequent risk of breast cancer in the Nurses' Health Study using Cox proportional hazards models. During 16 years of follow-up, 4,223 incident cases of breast cancer occurred among 77,418 women in this cohort. Compared with women sleeping 7 hours, covariate-adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for those sleeping [������]5, 6, 8, and [������]9 hours were 0.93 (0.79-1.09), 0.98 (0.91-1.06), 1.05 (0.97-1.13), and 0.95 (0.82-1.11), respectively. A moderate trend in risk increase towards longer sleep duration was observed when analyses were restricted to participants who reported same sleep duration in 1986 and 2000 (Ptrend = 0.05). In this prospective study, we found no convincing evidence for an association between sleep duration and the incidence of breast cancer. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(10): 5521-25)},

  Abstract                 = {Time-series, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies have observed associations between mortality and particulate air pollution but have been limited by ecologic design or small number of subjects or study areas. The present study evaluates effects of particulate air pollution on mortality using data from a large cohort drawn from many study areas. We linked ambient air pollution data from 151 {U.S.} metropolitan areas in 1980 with individual risk factor on 552,138 adults who resided in these areas when enrolled in a prospective study in 1982. Deaths were ascertained through December, 1989. Exposure to sulfate and fine particulate air pollution, which is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, was estimated from national data bases. The relationships of air pollution to all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality was examined using multivariate analysis which controlled for smoking, education, and other risk factors. Although small compared with cigarette smoking, an association between mortality and particulate air pollution was observed. Adjusted relative risk ratios (and 95\% confidence intervals) of all-cause mortality for the most polluted areas compared with the least polluted equaled 1.15 (1.09 to 1.22) and 1.17 (1.09 to 1.26) when using sulfate and fine particulate measures respectively. Particulate air pollution was associated with cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality but not with mortality due to other causes. Increased mortality is associated with sulfate and fine particulate air pollution at levels commonly found in {U.S.} cities. The increase in risk is not attributable to tobacco smoking, although other unmeasured correlates of pollution cannot be excluded with certainty.},

  Abstract                 = {An integrated evaluation of representative epidemiological evidence provides interesting insights regarding how cardiovascular mortality risks are affected by exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution. The literature can be interpreted as indicating that cardiovascular health effects are dependent on at least two dimensions of cumulative exposure������the intensity of exposure and the duration of exposure. The empirical evidence is incomplete and there are substantial limitations related to literature-based cross-study comparisons. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that there is a progressive approximately log reduction in the marginal increase in mortality risk for both dimensions of cumulative exposure. Longer duration exposure has larger, more persistent cumulative effects than short-term exposure, but the highest marginal effects occur with relatively short-term exposures most proximal in time. With regards to intensity of exposure, very steep, near-linear, exposure������response relationships are observed for low to moderate exposures and there is a flattening out or leveling off of the exposure������response function at very high exposures.},

The analysis indicates that changes in the spatial variation of various indicators of development do not follow a uniform pattern: the extent of interregional disparity differs with the indicator selected for measuring it. Furthermore, whereas development in the central part of Israel has tended to become more uniform over time, the country's peripheral regions have become more polarized.

  Abstract                 = {Background Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and effective lipid-lowering agents. Statins inhibit the growth of colon-cancer cell lines, and secondary analyses of some, but not all, clinical trials suggest that they reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Methods The Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study is a population-based case-control study of patients who received a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in northern Israel between 1998 and 2004 and controls matched according to age, sex, clinic, and ethnic group. We used a structured interview to determine the use of statins in the two groups and verified self-reported statin use by examining prescription records in a subgroup of patients for whom prescription records were available. Results In analyses including 1953 patients with colorectal cancer and 2015 controls, the use of statins for at least five years (vs. the nonuse of statins) was associated with a significantly reduced relative risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.63). This association remained significant after adjustment for the use or nonuse of aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; the presence or absence of physical activity, hypercholesterolemia, and a family history of colorectal cancer; ethnic group; and level of vegetable consumption (odds ratio, 0.53; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 0.74). The use of fibric-acid derivatives was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 2.01). Self-reported statin use was confirmed for 276 of the 286 participants (96.5 percent) who reported using statins and whose records were available. Conclusions The use of statins was associated with a 47 percent relative reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer after adjustment for other known risk factors. Because the absolute risk reduction is likely low, further investigation of the overall benefits of statins in preventing colorectal cancer is warranted.},

However, the situation is different for localities in which offenders reside. In many cases, property offenders travel considerable distances to their targets, showing no monotonic distance decay in their journey-to-crime patterns. The explanation proposed is that interurban income disparities, and not only travel distances, influence journey-to-crime areas, thus suggesting that the spatial unevenness of urban development (i.e., geographic proximity of affluent and poor towns) may spur property crime rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Although remote sensing data are often plentiful, they do not usually satisfy the users������ needs directly. Data assimilation is required to extract information about geophysical fields of interest from the remote sensing observations and to make the data more accessible to users. Remote sensing may provide, for example, measurements of surface soil moisture, snow water equivalent, snow cover, or land surface (skin) temperature. Data assimilation can then be used to estimate variables that are not directly observed from space but are needed for applications, for instance root zone soil moisture or land surface fluxes. The paper provides a brief introduction to modern data assimilation methods in the Earth sciences, their applications, and pertinent research questions. Our general overview is readily accessible to hydrologic remote sensing scientists. Within the general context of Earth science data assimilation, we point to examples of the assimilation of remotely sensed observations in land surface hydrology.},

For years it was assumed that polluting the daily dark period with light was inconsequential in terms of animal/human physiology. That assumption, however, has proven incorrect. Light at night has two major physiological actions, i.e., it disrupts circadian rhythms and suppresses the production of melatonin by the pineal gland. Moreover, both these changes are light intensity and wavelength dependent. Both human epidemiological and experimental studies on animals have documented that a potential negative consequence of chronodisruption and nocturnal melatonin inhibition is cancer initiation and growth. In epidemiological studies, the frequency of each of the following cancers has been reportedly increased in individuals who routinely work at night or whose circadian rhythms are disrupted for other reasons (e.g., due to jet lag): breast, prostate, endometrial, and colorectal. Likewise, in experimental animals, cancer growth is exaggerated when the animals are repeatedly phase advanced (as occurs during easterly flights) or exposed to light at night. A variety of mechanisms have been examined to explain how the suppression of melatonin exaggerates cancer risk. Mechanistically, how chronodisruption (without a consideration of melatonin suppression) would enhance cancer frequency is less clear. In addition to cancer, there may be other diseases that result from the chronic suppression of melatonin by light at night.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies show that ambient temperature and air pollution are associated with cardiovascular disease and that they may interact to affect cardiovascular events. However, few epidemiologic studies have examined mechanisms through which ambient temperature may influence cardiovascular function. The authors examined whether temperature was associated with heart rate variability ({HRV)} in a Boston, Massachusetts, study population and whether such associations were modified by ambient air pollution concentrations. The population was a cohort of 694 older men examined between 2000 and 2008. The authors fitted a mixed model to examine associations between temperature and air pollution and their interactions with repeated {HRV} measurements, adjusting for covariates selected a priori on the basis of their previous studies. Results showed that higher ambient temperature was associated with decreases in {HRV} measures (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals, low-frequency power, and high-frequency power) during the warm season but not during the cold season. These warm-season associations were significantly greater when ambient ozone levels were higher ({\textgreater}22.3 ppb) but did not differ according to levels of ambient fine (������2.5 ����m) particulate matter. The authors conclude that temperature and ozone, exposures to both of which are expected to increase with climate change, might act together to worsen cardiovascular health and/or precipitate cardiovascular events via autonomic nervous system dysfunction.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have reported an increased risk of myocardial infarction ({MI)} associated with acute increases in {PM} concentration. Recently, we reported that {MI/fine} particle ({PM2.5)} associations may be limited to transmural infarctions. In this study, we retained data on hospital discharges with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (using International Classification of Diseases ninth Revision [{ICD-9]} codes), for those admitted January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006, who were ������18 years of age, and were residents of New Jersey at the time of their {MI.} We excluded {MI} with a diagnosis of a previous {MI} and {MI} coded as a subendocardial infarction, leaving n = 1563 transmural infarctions available for analysis. We coupled these health data with {PM2.5} species concentrations predicted by the Community Multiscale Air Quality chemical transport model, ambient {PM2.5} concentrations, and used the same case-crossover methods to evaluate whether the relative odds of transmural {MI} associated with increased {PM2.5} concentration is modified by the {PM2.5} composition/mixture (i.e., mass fractions of sulfate, nitrate, elemental carbon, organic carbon, and ammonium). We found the largest relative odds estimates on the days with the highest tertile of sulfate mass fraction ({OR} = 1.13; 95\% {CI} = 1.00, 1.27), nitrate mass fraction ({OR} = 1.18; 95\% {CI} = 0.98, 1.35), and ammonium mass fraction ({OR} = 1.13; 95\% {CI} = 1.00 1.28), and the lowest tertile of {EC} mass fraction ({OR} = 1.17; 95\% {CI} = 1.03, 1.34). Air pollution mixtures on these days were enhanced in pollutants formed through atmospheric chemistry (i.e., secondary {PM2.5)} and depleted in primary pollutants (e.g., {EC).} When mixtures were laden with secondary {PM} species (sulfate, nitrate, and/or organics), we observed larger relative odds of myocardial infarction associated with increased {PM2.5} concentrations. Further work is needed to confirm these findings and examine which secondary {PM2.5} component(s) is/are responsible for an acute {MI} response.},

However there is also a relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular diseases. In big cities, a big or small particle concentration increase of 10 micro/m(3) is associated with a significantly higher risk of ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction, both when acute or chronic exposures are considered. The risk is higher for small particles. Similar risk increases are observed in patients with hypertension, stroke or severe arrhythmias. This association is independent of environmental distracters such as weather, temperature or humidity and of classical cardiovascular risk factors such as age, diabetes, dyslipidemia and obesity. Physicians should be aware of the problem and explain their patients the increased risk that they are facing due to air pollution.},

  Abstract                 = {We modeled the intraurban distribution of nitrogen dioxide ({NO(2))}, a marker for traffic pollution, with land use regression, a promising new exposure classification technique. We deployed diffusion tubes to measure {NO(2)} levels at 39 locations in the fall of 2003 in San Diego County, {CA}, {USA.} At each sample location, we constructed circular buffers in a geographic information system and captured information on roads, traffic flow, land use, population and housing. Using multiple linear regression, we were able to predict 79\% of the variation in {NO(2)} levels with four variables: traffic density within 40-300 m of the sampling location, traffic density within 300-1000 m, length of road within 40 m and distance to the Pacific coast. Applying this model to validation samples showed that the model predicted {NO(2)} levels within, on average, 2.1 p.p.b for 12 training sites initially excluded from the model. Our evaluation of this land use regression model showed that this method had excellent prediction and robustness in a North American context. These models may be useful tools in evaluating health effects of long-term exposure to traffic-related pollution.},

  Note                     = {Environmental epidemiology comprises the epidemiologic study of those environmental factors that are outside the immediate control of the individual. Exposures of interest to environmental epidemiologists include air pollution, water pollution, occupational exposure to physical and chemical agents, as well as psychosocial elements of environmental concern. The main methodologic problem in environmental epidemiology is exposure assessment, a problem that extends through all of epidemiologic research but looms as a towering obstacle in environmental epidemiology. One of the most promising developments in improving exposure assessment in environmental epidemiology is to find exposure biomarkers, which could serve as built-in dosimeters that reflect the biologic footprint left behind by environmental exposures. Beyond exposure assessment, epidemiologists studying environmental exposures face the difficulty of studying small effects that may be distorted by confounding that eludes easy control. This challenge may prompt reliance on new study designs, such as two-stage designs in which exposure and disease information are collected in the first stage, and covariate information is collected on a subset of subjects in state two. While the analytic methods already available for environmental epidemiology are powerful, analytic methods for ecologic studies need further development. This workshop outlines the range of methodologic issues that environmental epidemiologists must address so that their work meets the goals set by scientists and society at large.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Objective The human body displays marked asymmetry: paired organs differ bilaterally exerting effects upon cancer incidence and progression. However the factors involved remain contentious. In this large study involving over a quarter of a million cancer patients, we examine the epidemiological correlates of cancer laterality including incidence, stage at diagnosis and survival in the five major paired organs: the breasts, lungs, kidneys, testes and ovaries. Methods Cancer patients were selected from the Thames Cancer Registry database and age-standardised incidence rates ({ASRs)}, stage distribution at diagnosis and survival rates computed, stratifying appropriately. Results Cancer incidence differed significantly by laterality at all sites studied (p{\textless}0.01) but substantially in the lung (left������right incidence-rate ratio [{IRR]} 0.87), breast ({IRR} 1.07), testis ({IRR} 0.87) and in ovarian cancer ({IRR} 0.86). Autopsy data showed strongly coincident left������right organ size ratios (0.87 in the lungs and 0.87 in the testes). Patients with left testicular cancer, right lung cancer and left ovarian cancer showed significantly better survival than those with contralateral disease (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions In the lungs and testes, asymmetries in cancer incidence closely coincided with asymmetries in organ size. Our results suggest that tissue mass in these organs is an important contributor to asymmetry in cancer incidence.},

  Abstract                 = {This study, using geocodes of the locations of residence of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients from the Iowa Cancer Registry, computed continuous spatial patterns of late-stage rates of colorectal cancer in Iowa. Variations in rates in intrahospital service regions were as great as interhospital service regions, shown by analysis of variance tests. Some of the spatial variations observed could be explained, using a general linear regression model on individual-level data, by spatial variations in attributes of individuals and their relationships to health resources. We show how this source of variation can be removed from the original map leaving a new map showing the remaining variation in late-stage rate not explained by these relationships. We argue that it would be more appropriate to organize prevention and control activities targeted at the areas with higher than expected late-stage rates shown on this map. The originality of this approach is in the integration of geocoded data from a cancer registry with methods of spatial analysis that provide considerable geographic detail in the cancer rate while controlling for rate stabilization and reliability due to the small number problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Melatonin shows potential oncostatic action, and light exposure during night suppresses melatonin production. There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer. Methods: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks ({RRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)}, adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We observed a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among the women who worked 1-14 years or 15-29 years on rotating night shifts (multivariate adjusted {RR} = 1.08 [95\% {CI} = 0.99 to 1.18] and {RR} = 1.08 [95\% {CI} = 0.90 to 1.30], respectively). The risk was further increased among women who worked 30 or more years on the night shift ({RR} = 1.36; 95\% {CI} = 1.04 to 1.78). The test for trend was statistically significant (P = .02). Conclusions: Women who work on rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month, in addition to days and evenings in that month, appear to have a moderately increased risk of breast cancer after extended periods of working rotating night shifts.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Melatonin shows potential oncostatic activity and is acutely suppressed by light exposure. Some evidence suggests an association between night work and breast cancer risk, possibly through the melatonin pathway. {METHODS:} In a cohort of premenopausal nurses, we prospectively studied the relation between rotating night shift work and breast cancer risk. Total number of months during which the nurses worked rotating night shifts was first assessed at baseline in 1989 and periodically updated thereafter. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate relative risks ({RRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs).} {RESULTS:} Among 115,022 women without cancer at baseline, 1,352 developed invasive breast cancer during 12 years of follow up. Women who reported more than 20 years of rotating night shift work experienced an elevated relative risk of breast cancer compared with women who did not report any rotating night shift work (multivariate {RR} = 1.79; 95\% {CI} = 1.06-3.01). There was no increase in risk associated with fewer years of rotating night work. {CONCLUSION:} Our results suggest a modestly elevated risk of breast cancer after longer periods of rotating night work. Additional studies are warranted to rule out small sample size or uncontrolled sources for confounding as alternative explanations.},

  Abstract                 = {Particulate air pollution has been associated with increased mortality during episodes of high pollution concentrations. The relationship at lower concentrations has been more controversial, as has the relative role of particles and sulfur dioxide. Replication has been difficult because suspended particle concentrations are usually measured only every sixth day in the {U.S.} This study used concurrent measurements of total suspended particulates ({TSP)} and airport visibility from every sixth day sampling for 10 years to fit a predictive model for {TSP.} Predicted daily {TSP} concentrations were then correlated with daily mortality counts in Poisson regression models controlling for season, weather, time trends, overdispersion, and serial correlation. A significant correlation (P less than 0.0001) was found between predicted {TSP} and daily mortality. This correlation was independent of sulfur dioxide, but not vice versa. The magnitude of the effect was very similar to results recently reported from Steubenville, Ohio (using actual {TSP} measurements), with each 100 micrograms/m3 increase in {TSP} resulting in a 6\% increase in mortality. Graphical analysis indicated a dose-response relationship with no evidence of a threshold down to concentrations below half of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter.},

  Abstract                 = {Several studies in recent years have suggested that exposure to airborne particles and to ozone are associated with increases in respiratory hospital admissions. Few of those studies have used inhalable particles as their measure of exposure, and the studies did not always examine both particle and ozone exposure. This study examined the association between both {PM10} and ozone and respiratory hospital admissions for persons 65 yr of age and older in the Detroit, Michigan, metropolitan area during the years 1986 to 1989. After controlling for seasonal and other long-term temporal trends, temperature, and dew point temperature, both {PM10} ({RR} = 1.012, 95\% {CI} = 1.019-1.004) and 24-h ozone concentrations ({RR} = 1.026, 95\% {CI} = 1.040-1.013) were associated with daily admissions for pneumonia. The relative risks are for a 10-microgram/m3 increase in {PM10} and a 5-ppb increase in 24-h ozone concentration and from models including both pollutants. Admissions for {COPD} other than asthma were associated with {PM10} ({RR} = 1.020, 95\% {CI} = 1.032-1.009) and ozone ({RR} = 1.028, 95\% {CI} = 1.049-1.007) as well. Asthma admissions were not associated with either pollutant. Controlling for one pollutant did not effect the magnitude of the association with the other pollutant. The magnitude of these relative risks are very similar to those recently reported in Birmingham, Alabama, Ontario, and New York State. This suggests that the associations with both pollutants are likely to be causal.},

Airborne particles were associated with significant increases in daily deaths [0.67\% increase for a 10 microg/m(3) increase in particles; 95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 0.52-0.81\%]. This association was the same in summer and winter. To examine potential confounding by other pollutants, I regressed city- and season-specific effect sizes against the relationship between airborne particles and other pollutants. Controlling for other pollutants did not substantially (or significantly) change the estimated effect of airborne particles. Socioeconomic differences between cities likewise did not modify the effect. The increase in daily deaths that occurred out of hospitals (0.89\% per 10 microg/m(3); {CI}, 0.67-1.10\%) was substantially greater than the increase in deaths in hospitals (0. 49\%; {CI}, 0.31-0.68\%). This is consistent with results previously reported in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and suggests that the particle-associated deaths are not just being brought forward by a few days. It is also consistent with recent animal and human studies of the mechanisms of particle toxicity.},

  Abstract                 = {While time series analyses have demonstrated that airborne particles are associated with early death, they have not clarified how much the deaths are advanced. If all of the pollution-related deaths were advanced by only a few days, one would expect little association between weekly averages of air pollution and daily deaths. The author used the {STL} algorithm to classify data on air pollution, daily deaths, and weather from Boston, Massachusetts (1979-1986) into three time series: one reflecting seasonal and longer fluctuations, one reflecting short term fluctuations, and one reflecting intermediate patterns. By varying the cutoff point between short term and intermediate term, it was possible to examine harvesting on different time scales. For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there was evidence that most of the mortality was displaced by only a few months. For pneumonia, heart attacks, and all-cause mortality, the effect size increased with longer time scales. The percentage increase in all deaths associated with a 10-microg/m3 increase in {PM2.5} rose from 2.1\% (95\% confidence interval: 1.5, 4.3) to 3.75\% (95\% confidence interval: 3.2, 4.3) as the focus moved from daily patterns to monthly patterns. This is consistent with the larger effect seen in prospective cohort studies, rather than harvesting's playing a major role.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have linked air pollution to tens of thousands of premature cardiovascular deaths per year. The mechanisms of such associations remain unclear. In this study we examine the association between blood markers of cardiovascular risk and air pollution in a national sample of the {U.S.} population. Air pollution concentrations were merged to subjects in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES} {III)} in the United States, and the association with fibrinogen levels and counts of platelets and white blood cells were examined. The subjects in {NHANES} {III} are a representative sample of the {U.S.} population. Regressions controlled for age, race, sex, body mass index, current smoking, and number of cigarettes per day. The complex survey design was dealt with using mixed models with a random sampling site effect. In single-pollutant models, {PM(10)} (particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microm) was associated with all three outcomes (p{\textless} 0.05): Sulfur dioxide ({SO(2))} was significantly associated only with white cell counts, nitrogen dioxide ({NO(2))} with platelet counts and fibrinogen, and ozone with none of the outcomes. In two-pollutant models, {PM(10)} remained a significant predictor of white cell counts controlling for {SO(2)} but not vice versa. {PM(10)} was marginally significant in a model for platelet counts with {NO(2)}, and the sign of the {NO(2)} coefficient was reversed. These results were stable with control for indoor exposures (wood stoves, environmental tobacco smoke, gas stoves, fireplaces), dietary risk factors (saturated fat, alcohol, caffeine intake, n-3 fatty acids), and serum cholesterol. The magnitude of the effects are modest [e.g., 13 {microg/dL} fibrinogen for an interquartile range ({IQR)} change in {PM(subscript)10(/subscript)}, 95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 4.6-22.1 {mg/dL].} However, the odds ratio of being in the top 10\% of fibrinogen for the same {IQR} change was 1.77 (95\% {CI} 1.26-2.49). These effects provide considerable biologic plausibility to the mortality studies. {PM(10)}, but not gaseous air pollutants, is associated with blood markers of cardiovascular risk, and this may explain epidemiologic associations with early deaths.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Numerous studies have reported that day-to-day changes in particulate air pollution are associated with day-to-day changes in deaths. Recently, several reports have indicated that the software used to control for season and weather in some of these studies had deficiencies. {AIMS:} To investigate the use of the case-crossover design as an alternative. {METHODS:} This approach compares the exposure of each case to their exposure on a nearby day, when they did not die. Hence it controls for seasonal patterns and for all slowly varying covariates (age, smoking, etc) by matching rather than complex modelling. A key feature is that temperature can also be controlled by matching. This approach was applied to a study of 14 {US} cities. Weather and day of the week were controlled for in the regression. {RESULTS:} A 10 microg/m3 increase in {PM10} was associated with a 0.36\% increase in daily deaths from internal causes (95\% {CI} 0.22\% to 0.50\%). Results were little changed if, instead of symmetrical sampling of control days the time stratified method was applied, when control days were matched on temperature, or when more lags of winter time temperatures were used. Similar results were found using a Poisson regression, but the case-crossover method has the advantage of simplicity in modelling, and of combining matched strata across multiple locations in a single stage analysis. {CONCLUSIONS:} Despite the considerable differences in analytical design, the previously reported associations of particles with mortality persisted in this study. The association appeared quite linear. Case-crossover designs represent an attractive method to control for season and weather by matching.},

  Abstract                 = {Although particulate air pollution has been associated with increased numbers of daily deaths in dozens of cities around the world, issues still remain about the association. Some have questioned the complex modeling used to control for season in Poisson regression or the role of gaseous air pollutants as potential confounders of the association. I examined the association between deaths and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 microm ({PM10)} using a case-crossover design. In this approach, the pollution on the day of each death is contrasted with the pollution level on control days when the subject did not die. Season and gaseous air pollutants were controlled by matching. Control days were chosen within the same month of the same year to control for season, and matched on either sulfur dioxide ({SO2;} within 1 ppb), nitrogen dioxide (within 1 ppb), maximum ozone (within 2 ppb), or carbon monoxide (within 0.03 ppm). The analysis was conducted in 14 {U.S.} cities that have daily {PM10} monitoring. After matching, there were about 400,000 deaths in each analysis. Results were combined across cities using a maximum likelihood method. {PM10} was a significant predictor of mortality when controlling for gaseous air pollutants, with effect sizes ranging from a 0.45\% increase per 10 microg/m3 increment of {PM10} [95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 0.12-0.79\%] when matched on maximum hourly ozone levels, to a 0.81\% increase per 10 microg/m3 increment of {PM10} (95\% {CI}, 0.47-1.16\%) when matched on 24-hr average {SO2.}},

  Abstract                 = {Genotoxic air pollution is ubiquitous in urban and industrial areas. A variety of studies has linked human exposure to air pollution with a number of different somatic cell endpoints including cancer. However, the potential for inducing mutations in the human germline remains unclear. Sentinel animal studies of germline mutations at tandem-repeat loci (specifically minisatellites and expanded simple tandem repeats) have recently provided proof of principle that germline mutations can be induced in vertebrates (birds and mice) by air pollution under ambient conditions. Although humans may also be susceptible to induced germline mutations in polluted areas, uncertainties regarding causative agents, doses, and mutational mechanisms at repetitive {DNA} loci currently preclude extrapolation from animal data to the evaluation of human risk. Nevertheless, several recent studies have linked air pollution exposure to {DNA} damage in human sperm, indicating that our germ cells are not impervious to the genotoxic effects of air pollution. Thus, both sentinel animal and human studies have raised the possibility that ambient air pollution may increase human germline mutation rates, especially at repetitive {DNA} loci. Given that some human genetic conditions appear to be modulated by length mutations at tandem-repeat loci (e.g. {HRAS1} cancers, type 1 diabetes, etc.), there is an urgent need for extensive study in this area. Research should be primarily focused upon: (1) the direct measurement of mutation frequencies at repetitive {DNA} loci in human male germ cells as a function of air pollution exposure, (2) large-scale epidemiology studies of inherited disorders and tandem-repeat associated genetic conditions and air pollution, and (3) the characterization of mutational mechanisms at hypervariable tandem-repeat loci.},

  Abstract                 = {{BackgroundBackground} Hydration has been proposed as a treatment for women with preterm labour. Theoretically, hydration may reduce uterine contractility by increasing uterine blood flow and by decreasing pituitary secretion of antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin. {ObjectivesObjectives} To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous or oral hydration to avoid preterm birth and its consequences in women with preterm labour. Search {methodsSearch} methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (May 2009) and bibliographies of relevant papers. Selection {criteriaSelection} criteria Randomised controlled trials, including women with a viable pregnancy less than 37 completed weeks' gestation and presenting with preterm labour, comparing intravenous or oral hydration with no treatment. The intervention might or might not be associated with bed rest. Studies comparing tocolytic drugs with intravenous fluids used in the control group as a placebo were not included in this review. Data collection and {analysisData} collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the reports, to determine if the study met the inclusion criteria and to evaluate the methodological quality. Data were extracted independently by two of the review authors. The results were expressed as risk ratios ({RR)} for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes. Main {resultsMain} results Two studies, including a total of 228 women with preterm labour and intact membranes, compared intravenous hydration with bed rest alone. Risk of preterm delivery, before 37 weeks ({RR)} 1.09; 95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 0.71 to 1.68), before 34 weeks ({RR} 0.72; 95\% {CI} 0.20 to 2.56) or before 32 weeks ({RR} 0.76; 95\% {CI} 0.29 to 1.97), was similar between groups. Admission to neonatal intensive care unit occurred with similar frequency in both groups ({RR} 0.99; 95\% {CI} 0.46 to 2.16). Cost of treatment was slightly higher ({US\$39)} in the hydration group. This difference was not statistically significant and only includes hospital costs during a visit of less than 24 hours. No studies evaluated oral hydration. Authors' {conclusionsAuthors'} conclusions The data are too few to support the use of hydration as a specific treatment for women presenting with preterm labour. The two small studies available do not show any advantage of hydration compared to bed rest alone. Intravenous hydration does not seem to be beneficial, even during the period of evaluation soon after admission, in women with preterm labour. Women with evidence of dehydration may, however, benefit from the intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {Life in industrialized societies is primarily life inside buildings. Illumination from electric lighting in the built environment is quite different from solar radiation in intensity, spectral content, and timing during the 24-hour daily period. Humans evolved over millions of years with the day������night pattern of solar radiation as the primary circadian cue. This pattern maintained a 24-hour rhythm of melatonin release, as well as a host of other physiological rhythms including the sleep������wake cycle. Electric lighting in the built environment is generally more than sufficient for visual performance, but may be inappropriate for the maintenance of normal neuroendocrine rhythms in humans; e.g., insufficient during the day and too much at night. Lighting standards and engineering stress visual performance, whereas circadian function is not currently emphasized. The molecular biological research on the circadian clock and on mechanisms of phototransduction makes it clear that light for vision and light for circadian function are not identical systems. In particular, if electric lighting as currently employed contributes to `circadian disruption' it may be an important cause of `endocrine disruption' and thereby contribute to a high risk of breast cancer in industrialized societies.},

  Abstract                 = {Risk of breast cancer varies by about 5-fold among societies, and incidence and mortality have been increasing worldwide for many decades. Migrants from low-risk Asian societies to the {U.S.} suffer elevated risk of breast cancer in their own lifetimes, and the second or third generation Asian-Americans attain the high risk of the multi-generational European immigrants [1,2]. Something about a modern Western lifestyle apparently increases risk dramatically. Madigan et al. [3] estimate that 41\% of the new {U.S.} cases of breast cancer are explained by "known risk factors"; these include the reproductive factors of age at first birth, menarche, menopause. They ascribe about 30\% to reproductive factors when they are analyzed alone. {"High} income" is estimated to account for about 19\% when analyzed by itself. The 41\% is an analysis taking all the factors together, and since they are related, the total is less than the sum of estimates for the individual items. By itself, {"High} income" has no biological interpretation and must reflect attributes of lifestyle and/or environment that increase risk. So, the proportion of breast cancer cases in the {U.S.} that can be accounted for by known biological risk factors is about one third. Therefore, at least half of breast cancer risk in the {U.S.}, and other Westernized/industrialized societies, is in excess of that found in non-industrialized societies and is without any agreed-upon explanation. Many candidate factors exist, each with a cadre of proponents. The sum of these may turn out to explain the bulk of the excess risk in modern societies. On the other hand, they may not, and worse, may fall woefully short.},

  Abstract                 = {The global impact of breast cancer is large and growing. It seems clear that something about modern life is the culprit, yet there is thus far a lack of satisfactory explanations for most of the increases in risk as societies industrialize. Support has developed for a possible role of "circadian disruption," particularly from an altered-lighted environment (such as light at night). Lighting during the night of sufficient intensity can disrupt circadian rhythms, including reduction of circulating melatonin levels and resetting of the circadian pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Reduced melatonin may increase breast cancer risk through several mechanisms, including increased estrogen production and altered estrogen receptor function. The genes that drive the circadian rhythm are emerging as central players in gene regulation throughout the organism, particularly for cell-cycle regulatory genes and the genes of apoptosis. Aspects of modern life that can disrupt circadian rhythms during the key developmental periods (eg, in utero and during adolescence) may be particularly harmful. Epidemiologic studies should consider gene and environment interactions such as circadian gene variants and shift work requirements on the job.},

  Abstract                 = {Almost 10\% of all births are preterm, and 2.2\% are stillbirths. Recent research has suggested that environmental factors may be a contributory cause of these adverse birth outcomes. The authors examined the relation between ambient temperature and preterm birth and stillbirth in Brisbane, Australia, between 2005 and 2009 (n = 101,870). They used a Cox proportional hazards model with livebirth and stillbirth as competing risks. They also examined whether there were periods in pregnancy where exposure to high temperatures had a greater effect. Higher ambient temperatures in the last 4 weeks of the pregnancy increased the risk of stillbirth. The hazard ratio for stillbirth was 0.3 at {12����C} relative to the reference temperature of {21����C.} The temperature effect was greatest at less than 36 weeks of gestation. There was an association between higher temperature and shorter gestation, as the hazard ratio for livebirth was 0.96 at {15����C} and 1.02 at {25����C.} This effect was greatest at later gestational ages. These results provide strong evidence of an association between increased temperature and increased risk of stillbirth and shorter gestation.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} There is a strong link between urbanization and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although a multitude of mechanisms have been proposed, there are no studies evaluating the impact of ambient air pollutants and the propensity to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that exposure to ambient fine particulate matter ({\textless}2.5 mum; {PM(2.5))} exaggerates diet-induced insulin resistance, adipose inflammation, and visceral adiposity. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS:} Male {C57BL/6} mice were fed high-fat chow for 10 weeks and randomly assigned to concentrated ambient {PM(2.5)} or filtered air (n=14 per group) for 24 weeks. {PM(2.5)-exposed} {C57BL/6} mice exhibited marked whole-body insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, and an increase in visceral adiposity. {PM(2.5)} exposure induced signaling abnormalities characteristic of insulin resistance, including decreased Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in the endothelium and increased protein kinase C expression. These abnormalilties were associated with abnormalities in vascular relaxation to insulin and acetylcholine. {PM(2.5)} increased adipose tissue macrophages (F4/80(+) cells) in visceral fat expressing higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interleukin-6 and lower interleukin-{10/N-acetyl-galactosamine} specific lectin 1. To test the impact of {PM(2.5)} in eliciting direct monocyte infiltration into fat, we rendered {FVBN} mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein ({YFP)} under control of a monocyte-specific promoter (c-fms, c-fms({YFP))} diabetic over 10 weeks and then exposed these mice to {PM(2.5)} or saline intratracheally. {PM(2.5)} induced {YFP} cell accumulation in visceral fat and potentiated {YFP} cell adhesion in the microcirculation. {CONCLUSIONS:} {PM(2.5)} exposure exaggerates insulin resistance and visceral inflammation/adiposity. These findings provide a new link between air pollution and type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

  Abstract                 = {We estimated global marketed and non-marketed economic value from two classified satellite images with global coverage at 1 km2 resolution. {GDP} (a measure of marketed economic output) is correlated with the amount of light energy ({LE)} emitted by that nation as measured by nighttime satellite images. {LE} emitted is more spatially explicit than whole country {GDP}, may (for some nations or regions) be a more accurate indicator of economic activity than {GDP} itself, can be directly observed, and can be easily updated on an annual basis. As far as we know, this is the first global map of estimated economic activity produced at this high spatial resolution (1 km2). Ecosystem services product ({ESP)} is an important type of non-marketed value. {ESP} at 1 km2 resolution was estimated using the {IGBP} land-cover dataset and unit ecosystem service values estimated by Costanza et al. [Valuing Ecosystem Services with Efficiency, Fairness and Sustainability as Goals. Nature's Services, Island Press, Washington {DC}, pp. 49-70]. The sum of these two ({GDP+ESP)=SEP} is a measure of the subtotal ecological-economic product (marketed plus a significant portion of the non-marketed). The ratio: ({ESP/SEP)������100=\%ESP} is a measure of proportion of the {SEP} from ecosystem services. Both {SEP} and {\%ESP} were calculated and mapped for each 1 km2 pixel on the earth's surface, and aggregated by country. Results show the detailed spatial patterns of {GDP}, {ESP}, and {SEP} (also available at: http://www.du.edu/{\textasciitilde}{psutton/esiindexisee/EcolEconESI.htm).} Globally, while {GDP} is concentrated in the northern industrialized countries, {ESP} is concentrated in tropical regions and in wetlands and other coastal systems. {\%ESP} ranges from 1\% for Belgium and Luxembourg to 3\% for the Netherlands, 18\% for India, 22\% for the United States, 49\% for Costa Rica, 57\% for Chile, 73\% for Brazil, and 92\% for Russia. While {GDP} per capita has the usual northern industrialized countries at the top of the list, {SEP} per capita shows a quite different picture, with a mixture of countries with either high {GDP/capita}, high {ESP/capita}, or a combination near the top of the list. Finally, we compare our results with two other indices: (1) The 2001 Environmental Sustainability Index ({ESI)} derived as an initiative of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow Environment Task Force, World Economic Forum, and (2) Ecological Footprints of Nations: How much Nature do they use? How much Nature do they have? developed by Mathis Wackernagel and others. While both of these indices purport to measure sustainability, the {ESI} is actually mainly a measure of economic activity (and is correlated with {GDP)}, while the Eco-Footprint index is a measure of environmental impact. The related eco-deficit (national ecological capacity minus national footprint) correlates well with {\%ESP.}},

  Abstract                 = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVE:} As part of the {APHEA} project this study examined the association between airborne particles and hospital admissions for cardiac causes ({ICD9} 390-429) in eight European cities (Barcelona, Birmingham, London, Milan, the Netherlands, Paris, Rome, and Stockholm). All admissions were studied, as well as admissions stratified by age. The association for ischaemic heart disease ({ICD9} 410-413) and stroke ({ICD9} 430-438) was also studied, also stratified by age. {DESIGN:} Autoregressive Poisson models were used that controlled for long term trend, season, influenza epidemics, and meteorology to assess the short-term effects of particles in each city. The study also examined confounding by other pollutants. City specific results were pooled in a second stage regression to obtain more stable estimates and examine the sources of heterogeneity. {MAIN} {RESULTS:} The pooled percentage increases associated with a 10 micro g/m(3) increase in {PM(10)} and black smoke were respectively 0.5\% (95\% {CI:} 0.2 to 0.8) and 1.1\% (95\% {CI:} 0.4 to 1.8) for cardiac admissions of all ages, 0.7\% (95\% {CI:} 0.4 to 1.0) and 1.3\% (95\% {CI:} 0.4 to 2.2) for cardiac admissions over 65 years, and, 0.8\% (95\% {CI:} 0.3 to 1.2) and 1.1\% (95\% {CI:} 0.7 to 1.5) for ischaemic heart disease over 65 years. The effect of {PM(10)} was little changed by control for ozone or {SO(2)}, but was substantially reduced ({CO)} or eliminated ({NO(2))} by control for other traffic related pollutants. The effect of black smoke remained practically unchanged controlling for {CO} and only somewhat reduced controlling for {NO(2).} {CONCLUSIONS:} These effects of particulate air pollution on cardiac admissions suggest the primary effect is likely to be mainly attributable to diesel exhaust. Results for ischaemic heart disease below 65 years and for stroke over 65 years were inconclusive.},

  Abstract                 = {In September 2006, the {US} Environmental Protection Agency and the {US} Centers for Disease Control ({CDC)} co-organized a symposium on {"Air} Pollution Exposure and Health." The main objective of this symposium was to identify opportunities for improving the use of exposure and health information in future studies of air pollution health effects. This paper deals with the health information needs of such studies. We begin with a selected review of different types of health data and how they were used in previous epidemiologic studies of health effects of ambient particulate matter ({PM).} We then examine the current and emerging information needs of the environmental health community, dealing with {PM} and other air pollutants of health concern. We conclude that the past use of routinely collected health data proved to be essential for activities to protect public health, including the identification and evaluation of health hazards by air pollution research, setting standards for criteria pollutants, surveillance of health outcomes to identify incidence trends, and the more recent {CDC} environmental public health tracking program. Unfortunately, access to vital statistics records that have informed such pivotal research has recently been curtailed sharply, threatening the continuation of the type of research necessary to support future standard setting and research on emerging exposure and health problems (e.g. asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and others), as well as our ability to evaluate the efficacy of regulatory and other prevention activities. A comprehensive devoted effort, perhaps new legislation, will be needed to address the standardization, centralization, and sharing of data sets, as well as to harmonize the interpretation of confidentiality and privacy protections across jurisdictions. These actions, combined with assuring researchers and public health practitioners appropriate access to data for evaluation of environmental risks, will be essential for the achievement of our environmental health protection goals.},

  Abstract                 = {The estimation of near surface air temperature (Ta) is useful for a wide range of applications such as agriculture, climate related diseases and climate change studies. Air temperature is commonly obtained from synoptic measurements in weather stations. In Africa, the spatial distribution of weather stations is often limited and the dissemination of temperature data is variable, therefore limiting their use for real-time applications. Compensation for this paucity of information may be obtained by using satellite-based methods. However, the derivation of near surface air temperature (Ta), from the land surface temperature (Ts) derived from satellite is far from straight forward. Some studies have tried to derive maximum Ta from satellites through regression analysis but the accuracy obtained is quite variable according to the study. The main objective of this study was to explore the possibility of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} Ts products over different ecosystems in Africa. First, comparisons between night {MODIS} Ts data with minimum Ta showed that {MODIS} nighttime products provide a good estimation of minimum Ta over different ecosystems (with ({����Ts} ������ Ta) centered at 0 {����C}, a mean absolute error ({MAE)} = 1.73 {����C} and a standard deviation = 2.4 {����C).} Secondly, comparisons between day {MODIS} Ts data with maximum Ta showed that ({����Ts} ������ Ta) strongly varies according to the seasonality, the ecosystems, the solar radiation, and cloud-cover. Two factors proposed in the literature to retrieve maximum Ta from Ts, i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI)} and the Solar Zenith Angle ({SZA)}, were analyzed. No strong relationship between ({����Ts} ������ Ta) and (i) {NDVI} and (ii) {SZA} was observed, therefore requiring further research on robust methods to retrieve maximum Ta.},

  Abstract                 = {Breast cancer incidence has increased during recent decades for reasons that are only partly understood. Prevalence of sleeping difficulties and sleepiness has increased, whereas sleeping duration per night has decreased. We hypothesized that there is an inverse association between sleep duration and breast cancer risk, possibly due to greater overall melatonin production in longer sleepers. This population-based study includes information from women born in Finland before 1958. Sleep duration, other sleep variables, and breast cancer risk factors were assessed by self-administered questionnaires given in 1975 and in 1981. Breast cancer incidence data for 1976 to 1996 was obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios ({HR)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI)} were obtained from Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders. Altogether, 242 cases of breast cancer occurred over the study period among the 12,222 women with sleep duration data in 1975. For these women, the {HRs} for breast cancer in the short ([������]6 hours), average (7-8 hours), and long sleep ([������]9 hours) duration groups were 0.85 ({CI}, 0.54-1.34), 1.0 (referent), and 0.69 ({CI}, 0.45-1.06), respectively. Analysis restricted to the 7,396 women (146 cases) whose sleep duration in 1975 and 1981 were in the same duration group (stable sleepers) yielded {HRs} of 1.10 ({CI}, 0.59-2.05), 1.0, and 0.28 ({CI}, 0.09-0.88), with a decreasing trend (P = 0.03). This study provides some support for a decreased risk of breast cancer in long sleepers.},

It reviews mechanistic investigations that have evaluated the links among exposure to pollutants, thrombosis, pulmonary inflammation, arterial vasoconstriction and heart rate variability.

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:The} availability of geographic information from cancer and birth defect registries has increased public demands for investigation of perceived disease clusters. Many neighborhood-level cluster investigations are methodologically problematic, while maps made from registry data often ignore latency and many known risk factors. Population-based case-control and cohort studies provide a stronger foundation for spatial epidemiology because potential confounders and disease latency can be {addressed.METHODS:We} investigated the association between residence and colorectal, lung, and breast cancer on upper Cape Cod, Massachusetts ({USA)} using extensive data on covariates and residential history from two case-control studies for 1983-1993. We generated maps using generalized additive models, smoothing on longitude and latitude while adjusting for covariates. The resulting continuous surface estimates disease rates relative to the whole study area. We used permutation tests to examine the overall importance of location in the model and identify areas of increased and decreased {risk.RESULTS:Maps} of colorectal cancer were relatively flat. Assuming 15 years of latency, lung cancer was significantly elevated just northeast of the Massachusetts Military Reservation, although the result did not hold when we restricted to residences of longest duration. Earlier non-spatial epidemiology had found a weak association between lung cancer and proximity to gun and mortar positions on the reservation. Breast cancer hot spots tended to increase in magnitude as we increased latency and adjusted for covariates, indicating that confounders were partly hiding these areas. Significant breast cancer hot spots were located near known groundwater plumes and the Massachusetts Military {Reservation.DISCUSSION:Spatial} epidemiology of population-based case-control studies addresses many methodological criticisms of cluster studies and generates new exposure hypotheses. Our results provide evidence for spatial clustering of breast cancer on upper Cape Cod.

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:It} is currently not clear whether individuals living in metropolitan areas differ from individuals living in rural and urban areas with respect to smoking behaviours. Therefore, we sought to explore the relation between residential area and smoking behaviours in {Germany.METHODS:We} used a nationwide German census representative for the general population of Germany. A number of 181,324 subjects aged 10 years or older were included. Information on the average daily usage of cigarettes that have or had been smoked formerly or currently was available in subjects who have ever smoked. A daily consumption of more than 20 cigarettes was considered heavy smoking. Logistic regression analyses were performed sex-stratified and adjusted for relevant {confounders.RESULTS:Analyses} revealed inhabitants of metropolitan areas to be more likely current smokers than inhabitants of rural areas (odds ratio 1.56, 95\%-confidence interval 1.51; 1.62). Among current and former smokers those who lived in urban communities had also increased odds for being heavy smokers than those who lived in rural {communities.CONCLUSION:We} conclude that living in an urban and particularly living in a metropolitan area is a determinant of both smoking and severity of current smoking. Tobacco control programs should recognize the difference in living conditions between rural and urban areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Land surface temperature ({LST)} is a key parameter in land������atmosphere interactions. The recently released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers ({MODIS)} {LST} Version 5 products have provided good tools to evaluate water and energy budget modelling for river basins. In this study, a distributed biosphere hydrological model ({WEB-DHM;} so-called water and energy budget-based distributed hydrological model) that couples a biosphere scheme ({SiB2)} with a geomorphology-based hydrological model ({GBHM)}, is applied to the upper Tone River Basin where flux observations are not available. The model facilitates a better understanding of the water and energy cycles in this region. After being calibrated with discharge data, {WEB-DHM} is assessed against observed streamflows at four major gauges and {MODIS} {LST.} Results show that long-term streamflows including annual largest floods are well reproduced. As well, both daytime and nighttime {LSTs} simulated by {WEB-DHM} agree well with {MODIS} observations for both basin-averaged values and spatial patterns. The validated model is then used to analyze water and energy cycles of the upper Tone River Basin. It was found that from May to October, with relatively large leaf area index ({LAI)} values, the simulated daily maximum {LST} is close to soil surface temperature (Tg) since Tg is much greater than canopy temperature (Tc) in their peak values; while the daily minimum {LST} appears similar to Tc. For other months with relatively small {LAI} values, the diurnal cycles of {LST} closely follow Tg.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of the anatomical and molecular substrates of the system that encodes changes in photoperiod in the duration of melatonin secretion, and the receptor molecules that read this signal, have been shown to be conserved in monkeys and humans, and the functions of this system appear to be intact from the level of the retina to the level of the melatonin-duration signal of change of season. While photoperiodic seasonal breeding has been shown to occur in monkeys, it remains unclear whether photoperiod and mediation of photoperiod's effects by melatonin influence human reproduction. Epidemiological evidence suggests that inhibition of fertility by heat in men in summer contributes to seasonal variation in human reproduction at lower latitudes and that stimulation of fertility by lengthening of the photoperiod in spring contributes to the variation at higher latitudes. Parallels between the seasonality of human reproduction and seasonal affective disorder suggest that they may be governed by common biological processes. Historical and experimental evidence indicates that human responses to seasonal changes in the natural photoperiod may have been more robust prior to the Industrial Revolution and that subsequently they have been increasingly suppressed by alterations of the physical environment.},

Within education and income strata, Black women had a less favorable stage of disease at diagnosis than Whites.

  Abstract                 = {Low birth weight, a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality, is caused by different factors in Western and developing-country populations. In addition to differing in terms of ethnicity, maternal size, maternal nutritional status, and disease load, developing-country and Western populations are also characterized by different environmental heat loads. Thermodynamic theory predicts that heat stress is mitigated by reduced size of both mother and offspring, and therefore generates the hypothesis that reduced birth weight may be an adaptation to environmental heat load. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that environmental heat load is associated with between-population variability in birth weight. Data on birth weight and thermal environment were obtained from the literature for 140 populations. Further data on several physical, social, and biological confounders were also collated. After adjusting for confounding factors, of which only maternal height and per capita gross domestic product were statistically significant, heat stress showed a significant inverse relationship with birth weight in 108 populations, accounting for an additional 9.6\% of the between-population variance. Though based on data collected from more than one source, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that heat stress is inversely associated with birth weight, as previously reported for within-population studies. Further studies are needed to establish to what extent heat stress is a determinant of low birth weight in developing countries.

  Abstract                 = {Human birth weight is known to be influenced by several factors, including maternal energy supply, maternal stature, disease status, smoking status and gestation length. This article proposes that the thermal environment may be a further factor influencing birth weight. Experimental animal studies demonstrate clear effects of thermal stress on placental function and birth weight, but may have limited relevance for humans due to between-species differences in pregnancy physiology. Observational studies suggest an inverse relationship between environmental temperature and birth weight within and between human populations. Variation in maternal size, body fatness, pregnancy weight gain and heat production is predicted to influence maternal thermoregulatory capacity, as are the size and composition of the foetus. These associations generate the hypothesis that low birth weight in hot environments may in part represent an adaptation to environmental heat stress.},

In Cumbria, the hazard of foot-and-mouth disease infection peaked at 2.8\% in the week commencing 8 March 2001 and farm holdings in this area continued to be identified with disease to 12 September 2001. In contrast, peak infection hazard in Devon was 0.7\% in the week commencing 15 March 2001 and eradication of the disease was achieved in this area by 31 May 2001. Persistence of the disease in Cumbria was consistent with: (1) many cattle holdings infected early in the epidemic (creating a high environmental viral load), and (2) a relatively large amount of medium-to-long-distance spread of the virus associated with seasonal farming activities--compounded to some extent by the movement of people and vehicles between disaggregated farm land parcels. The interaction of disease risk in Cumbria showed that premises remained infectious for longer throughout May, June and July, consistent with delays in disease detection during this period.},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemiologic studies of disinfection by-products have traditionally focused on total trihalomethane ({TTHM)} concentration as a surrogate for maternal exposure during pregnancy. We used birth certificate data on 196,000 infants to examine the effect of third-trimester exposures on various indices of fetal development. We examined the effect of town-average concentrations of {TTHM} and additional exposure metrics in relation to mean birth weight, mean gestational age, small for gestational age ({SGA)} infancy, and preterm delivery. Trihalomethane data ({TTHM}, chloroform, and bromodichloromethane) from 1995-1998 were available for 109 towns in Massachusetts. Data from 1997-1998 on haloacetic acid (total haloacetic acids, dichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid), 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5- hydroxy-2({5H)-furanone} ({MX)}, and mutagenicity were available for a limited number of towns. We observed reductions in mean birth weight (12-18 g) for maternal trihalomethane exposures {\textgreater} the 90th percentile compared with those {\textless} the 50th percentile. Birth weight reductions were detected for chloroform exposures {\textgreater} 20 {microg/L} and {TTHM} exposures {\textgreater} 40 {microg/L.} Elevated trihalomethanes were associated with increases in gestational duration and a reduced risk of preterm delivery. We found evidence of an exposure-response effect of trihalomethanes on risk of {SGA}, with odds ratios ({ORs)} ranging from 1.09 to 1.23 for bromodichloromethane exposures {\textgreater} 5 {microg/L.} Elevated mutagenic activity was associated with {SGA} [{OR} = 1.25; 95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 1.04 to 1.51] and mean birth weight (-27 g; 95\% {CI}, -54 to -1). Although smaller in magnitude, our findings are consistent with previous studies reporting associations between trihalomethanes and {SGA.} These data also suggest a relationship between fetal development indices and mutagenic activity independent of exposure to trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, and {MX.}},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Prior studies have demonstrated a link between air pollution and metabolic diseases such as type {II} diabetes. Changes in adipose tissue and its mitochondrial content/function are closely associated with the development of insulin resistance and attendant metabolic complications. We investigated changes in adipose tissue structure and function in brown and white adipose depots in response to chronic ambient air pollutant exposure in a rodent model. {METHODS:} Male {ApoE} knockout ({ApoE-/-)} mice inhaled concentrated fine ambient {PM} ({PM} {\textless} 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter; {PM2.5)} or filtered air ({FA)} for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 2 months. We examined superoxide production by dihydroethidium staining; inflammatory responses by immunohistochemistry; and changes in white and brown adipocyte-specific gene profiles by real-time {PCR} and mitochondria by transmission electron microscopy in response to {PM2.5} exposure in different adipose depots of {ApoE-/-} mice to understand responses to chronic inhalational stimuli. {RESULTS:} Exposure to {PM2.5} induced an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species ({ROS)} in brown adipose depots. Additionally, exposure to {PM2.5} decreased expression of uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose tissue as measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Mitochondrial number was significantly reduced in white ({WAT)} and brown adipose tissues ({BAT)}, while mitochondrial size was also reduced in {BAT.} In {BAT}, {PM2.5} exposure down-regulated brown adipocyte-specific genes, while white adipocyte-specific genes were differentially up-regulated. {CONCLUSIONS:} {PM2.5} exposure triggers oxidative stress in {BAT}, and results in key alterations in mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial alterations that are pronounced in {BAT.} We postulate that exposure to {PM2.5} may induce imbalance between white and brown adipose tissue functionality and thereby predispose to metabolic dysfunction.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Chronic epidemiologic studies of particulate matter ({PM)} are limited by the lack of monitoring data, relying instead on citywide ambient concentrations to estimate exposures. This method ignores within-city spatial gradients and restricts studies to areas with nearby monitoring data. This lack of data is particularly restrictive for fine particles ({PM} with aerodynamic diameter {\textless} 2.5 microm; {PM(2.5))} and coarse particles ({PM} with aerodynamic diameter 2.5-10 microm; {PM(10-2.5))}, for which monitoring is limited before 1999. To address these limitations, we developed spatiotemporal models to predict monthly outdoor {PM(2.5)} and {PM(10-2.5)} concentrations for the northeastern and midwestern United States. {METHODS:} For {PM(2.5)}, we developed models for two periods: 1988-1998 and 1999-2002. Both models included smooth spatial and regression terms of geographic information system-based and meteorologic predictors. To compensate for sparse monitoring data, the pre-1999 model also included predicted {PM(10)} ({PM} with aerodynamic diameter {\textless} 10 microm) and extinction coefficients (km(-1)). {PM(10-2.5)} levels were estimated as the difference in monthly predicted {PM(10)} and {PM(2.5)}, with predicted {PM(10)} from our previously developed {PM(10)} model. {RESULTS:} Predictive performance for {PM(2.5)} was strong (cross-validation R2 = 0.77 and 0.69 for post-1999 and pre-1999 {PM(2.5)} models, respectively) with high precision (2.2 and 2.7 microg/m3, respectively). Models performed well irrespective of population density and season. Predictive performance for {PM(10-2.5)} was weaker (cross-validation R2 = 0.39) with lower precision (5.5 microg/m3). {PM(10-2.5)} levels exhibited greater local spatial variability than {PM(10)} or {PM(2.5)}, suggesting that {PM(2.5)} measurements at ambient monitoring sites are more representative for surrounding populations than for {PM(10)} and especially {PM(10-2.5).} {CONCLUSIONS:} We provide semiempirical models to predict spatially and temporally resolved long-term average outdoor concentrations of {PM(2.5)} and {PM(10-2.5)} for estimating exposures of populations living in the northeastern and midwestern United States.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, attention has focused on whether particulate air pollution is a specific trigger of myocardial infarction ({MI).} The results of several studies of single locations assessing the effects of ambient particular matter on the risk of {MI} have been disparate. We used a multicity case-crossover study to examine risk of emergency hospitalization associated with fine particulate matter ({PM)} with aerodynamic diameter {\textless} 10 ����m ({PM10)} for {\textgreater} 300,000 {MIs} during 1985������1999 among elderly residents of 21 {U.S.} cities. We used time-stratified controls matched on day of the week or on temperature to detect possible residual confounding by weather. Overall, we found a 0.65\% [95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 0.3������1.0\%] increased risk of hospitalization for {MI} per 10 ����g/m3 increase in ambient {PM10} concentration. Matching on apparent temperature yielded a 0.64\% increase in risk (95\% {CI}, 0.1������1.2\%). We found that the effect size for {PM10} doubled for subjects with a previous admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There was a weaker indication of a larger effect on males but no evidence of effect modification by age or the other diagnoses. We also found that the shape of the exposure������response relationship between {MI} hospitalizations and {PM10} is almost linear, but with a steeper slope at levels of {PM10} {\textless} 50 ����g/m3. We conclude that increased concentrations of ambient {PM10} are associated with increased risk of {MI} among the elderly.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Although many studies have examined the effects of air pollution on mortality, data limitations have resulted in fewer studies of both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ������ 2.5 ����m ({PM2.5;} fine particles) and of coarse particles (particles with an aerodynamic diameter {\textgreater} 2.5 and {\textless} 10 ����m; {PM} coarse). We conducted a national, multicity time-series study of the acute effect of {PM2.5} and {PM} coarse on the increased risk of death for all causes, cardiovascular disease ({CVD)}, myocardial infarction ({MI)}, stroke, and respiratory mortality for the years 1999������2005. Method We applied a city- and season-specific Poisson regression in 112 {U.S.} cities to examine the association of mean (day of death and previous day) {PM2.5} and {PM} coarse with daily deaths. We combined the city-specific estimates using a random effects approach, in total, by season and by region. Results We found a 0.98\% increase [95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 0.75������1.22] in total mortality, a 0.85\% increase (95\% {CI}, 0.46������1.24) in {CVD}, a 1.18\% increase (95\% {CI}, 0.48������1.89) in {MI}, a 1.78\% increase (95\% {CI}, 0.96������2.62) in stroke, and a 1.68\% increase (95\% {CI}, 1.04������2.33) in respiratory deaths for a 10-����g/m3 increase in 2-day averaged {PM2.5.} The effects were higher in spring. For {PM} coarse, we found significant but smaller increases for all causes analyzed. Conclusions We conclude that our analysis showed an increased risk of mortality for all and specific causes associated with {PM2.5}, and the risks are higher than what was previously observed for {PM10.} In addition, coarse particles are also associated with more deaths.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Although the association between exposure to particulate matter and health is well established, there remains uncertainty as to whether certain chemical components are more harmful than others. We explored whether the association between cause-specific hospital admissions and {PM(2.5)} was modified by {PM(2.5)} chemical composition. {METHODS:} We estimated the association between daily {PM(2.5)} and emergency hospital admissions for cardiac causes ({CVD)}, myocardial infarction ({MI)}, congestive heart failure ({CHF)}, respiratory disease, and diabetes in 26 {US} communities, for the years 2000-2003. Using meta-regression, we examined how this association was modified by season- and community-specific {PM(2.5)} composition, controlling for seasonal temperature as a surrogate for ventilation. {RESULTS:} For a 10 microg/m3 increase in 2-day averaged {PM(2.5)} concentration we found an increase of 1.89\% (95\% {CI:} 1.34- 2.45) in {CVD}, 2.25\% (95\% {CI:} 1.10- 3.42) in {MI}, 1.85\% (95\% {CI:} 1.19- 2.51) in {CHF}, 2.74\% (95\% {CI:} 1.30- 4.2) in diabetes, and 2.07\% (95\% {CI:} 1.20- 2.95) in respiratory admissions. The association between {PM2.5} and {CVD} admissions was significantly modified when the mass was high in Br, Cr, Ni, and Na(+), while mass high in As, Cr, Mn, {OC}, Ni, and Na(+) modified {MI}, and mass high in As, {OC}, and {SO(4)(2-)} modified diabetes admissions. For these species, an interquartile range increase in their relative proportion was associated with a 1-2\% additional increase in daily admissions per 10 microg/m(3) increase in mass. {CONCLUSIONS:} We found that {PM(2.5)} mass higher in Ni, As, and Cr, as well as Br and {OC} significantly increased its effect on hospital admissions. This result suggests that particles from industrial combustion sources and traffic may, on average, have greater toxicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Misclassification of exposure is a well-recognized inherent limitation of epidemiologic studies of disease and the environment. For many agents of interest, exposures take place over time and in multiple locations; accurately estimating the relevant exposures for an individual participant in epidemiologic studies is often daunting, particularly within the limits set by feasibility, participant burden, and cost. Researchers have taken steps to deal with the consequences of measurement error by limiting the degree of error through a study's design, estimating the degree of error using a nested validation study, and by adjusting for measurement error in statistical analyses. In this paper, we address measurement error in observational studies of air pollution and health. Because measurement error may have substantial implications for interpreting epidemiologic studies on air pollution, particularly the time-series analyses, we developed a systematic conceptual formulation of the problem of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of air pollution and then considered the consequences within this formulation. When possible, we used available relevant data to make simple estimates of measurement error effects. This paper provides an overview of measurement errors in linear regression, distinguishing two extremes of a continuum-Berkson from classical type errors, and the univariate from the multivariate predictor case. We then propose one conceptual framework for the evaluation of measurement errors in the log-linear regression used for time-series studies of particulate air pollution and mortality and identify three main components of error. We present new simple analyses of data on exposures of particulate matter {\textless} 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter from the Particle Total Exposure Assessment Methodology Study. Finally, we summarize open questions regarding measurement error and suggest the kind of additional data necessary to address them.},

Maps of temperature-based agro-meteorological indices are commonly generated by the spatial interpolation of data collected from meteorological stations with coarse geographic continuity. To solve the critical problems of estimating air temperature (T a) and filling in missing pixels due to cloudy and low-quality images in growing degree days ({GDDs)} calculation from remotely sensed data, a novel spatio-temporal algorithm for T a estimation from Terra and Aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} data was proposed. This is a preliminary study to calculate heat accumulation, expressed in accumulative growing degree days ({AGDDs)} above 10 {����C}, from reconstructed T a based on {MODIS} land surface temperature ({LST)} data. The verification results of maximum T a, minimum T a, {GDD}, and {AGDD} from {MODIS-derived} data to meteorological calculation were all satisfied with high correlations over 0.01 significant levels. Overall, {MODIS-derived} {AGDD} was slightly underestimated with almost 10\% relative error. However, the feasibility of employing {AGDD} anomaly maps to characterize the 2001������2010 spatio-temporal variability of heat accumulation and estimating the 2011 heat accumulation distribution using only {MODIS} data was finally demonstrated in the current paper. Our study may supply a novel way to calculate {AGDD} in heat-related study concerning crop growth monitoring, agricultural climatic regionalization, and agro-meteorological disaster detection at the regional scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Short-term fine particles (PM2.5) exposure is associated with reduced heart rate variability, a strong predictor of cardiac mortality among older people. Identifying modifiable factors that confer susceptibility is essential for intervention. We evaluated whether Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) methylation, a reversible immune-epigenetic process, and its dietary modulation by flavonoids and methyl nutrients, modify susceptibility to heart rate variability effects following PM2.5 exposure.We measured heart rate variability and PM2.5 repeatedly over 11 years (1275 total observations) among 573 elderly men from the Normative Aging Study. Blood TLR2 methylation was analyzed using pyrosequencing. Daily flavonoid and methyl nutrients intakes were assessed through the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Every 10 $\mu$g/m(3) increase in 48-hour PM2.5 moving average was associated with 7.74\% (95\% CI: -1.21\% to 15.90\%; P=0.09), 7.46\% (95\% CI: 0.99\% to 13.50\%; P=0.02), 14.18\% (95\% CI: 1.14\% to 25.49\%; P=0.03), and 12.94\% (95\% CI: -2.36\% to 25.96\%; P=0.09) reductions in root mean square of successive differences, standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals, low-frequency power, and high-frequency power, respectively. Higher TLR2 methylation exacerbated the root mean square of successive differences, standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals, low-frequency, and high-frequency reductions associated with heightened PM2.5 (Pinteraction=0.006, 0.03, 0.05, 0.04, respectively). Every interquartile-range increase in flavonoid intake was associated with 5.09\% reduction in mean TLR2 methylation (95\% CI: 0.12\% to 10.06\%; P=0.05) and counteracted the effects of PM2.5 on low frequency (Pinteraction=0.05). No significant effect of methyl nutrients on TLR2 methylation was observed.Higher TLR2 methylation may confer susceptibility to adverse cardiac autonomic effects of PM2.5 exposure in older individuals. Higher flavonoid intake may attenuate these effects, possibly by decreasing TLR2 methylation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Accurate estimation of spatially distributed air temperature (Ta) is useful for a wide range of disciplines such as hydrology, meteorology and ecology. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} land surface temperature (Ts) products hold the potential to get spatial estimates of land surface temperature at high temporal (daily) and spatial resolution (1 km) across the world. In this paper, the possibility of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from {MODIS} Ts data on both Terra and Aqua satellites was investigated over Xiangride River basin in the north Tibetan Plateau. The results of statistical analysis show that during the night {MODIS} Ts data on Terra satellite provides a good estimation of daily minimum air temperature with {RMSE} = 2.97 {����C}, {MAE} = 2.37 {����C}, and r = 0.94, while during the day the difference between Terra {MODIS} Ts data and daily maximum air temperature is large with {RMSE} = 7.45 {����C}, {MAE} = 6.21 {����C}, and r = 0.83. In order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of daily maximum air temperature, the temperature-vegetation index ({TVX)} method was used in this paper. By lowering the threshold for the negative correlation coefficient between {NDVI} (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and Ts to ������ 0.1, the {TVX} method was applied to {MODIS} land products to estimate daily maximum air temperature successfully for the first time. The validation results show that the {TVX} method has improved the accuracy of daily maximum air temperature significantly with {RMSE} = 3.79 {����C}, {MAE} = 3.03 {����C}, and r = 0.83. Finally, the diurnal air temperature variation was simulated using a simple sine curve model for the period 21:00������9:00 {UCT.} The simulation results were in good agreement with observed values with {RMSE} = 3.43 {����C}, {MAE} = 2.54 {����C}, and r = 0.86. The results of this study show that daily maximum and minimum air temperature can be retrieved effectively from {MODIS} land surface products through the use of {TVX} method.},
