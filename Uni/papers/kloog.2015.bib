                  exploration and modelling of spatial point patterns
                  with particular reference to geographical
                  epidemiology (the geographical incidence of
                  disease). Such methods go well beyond the
                  conventional 'nearest-neighbour' and 'quadrat'
                  analyses which have little to offer in an
                  epidemiological context because they fail to allow
                  for spatial variation in population
                  density. Correction for this is essential if the aim
                  is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases
                  of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial
                  variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time
                  clustering, and we consider methods for modelling
                  the raised incidence of disease around suspected
                  point sources of pollution. All methods are
                  illustrated by reference to recent case studies
                  including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's
                  lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood
                  asthma. An Appendix considers a range of possible
                  software environments within which to apply these
                  methods. The links to modern geographical
                  information systems are discussed.},

  note =	 {Environmental epidemiology comprises the
                  epidemiologic study of those environmental factors
                  that are outside the immediate control of the
                  individual. Exposures of interest to environmental
                  epidemiologists include air pollution, water
                  pollution, occupational exposure to physical and
                  chemical agents, as well as psychosocial elements of
                  environmental concern. The main methodologic problem
                  in environmental epidemiology is exposure
                  assessment, a problem that extends through all of
                  epidemiologic research but looms as a towering
                  obstacle in environmental epidemiology. One of the
                  most promising developments in improving exposure
                  assessment in environmental epidemiology is to find
                  exposure biomarkers, which could serve as built-in
                  dosimeters that reflect the biologic footprint left
                  behind by environmental exposures. Beyond exposure
                  assessment, epidemiologists studying environmental
                  exposures face the difficulty of studying small
                  effects that may be distorted by confounding that
                  eludes easy control. This challenge may prompt
                  reliance on new study designs, such as two-stage
                  designs in which exposure and disease information
                  are collected in the first stage, and covariate
                  information is collected on a subset of subjects in
                  state two. While the analytic methods already
                  available for environmental epidemiology are
                  powerful, analytic methods for ecologic studies need
                  further development. This workshop outlines the
                  range of methodologic issues that environmental
                  epidemiologists must address so that their work
                  meets the goals set by scientists and society at
                  large.},

  note =	 {The theoretical content of Suicide has been
                  thoroughly discussed, but relatively little
                  attention has been paid to the ways in which
                  Durkheim tested and refined his theories with
                  empirical data. Durkheim's empirical analyses are
                  multivariate: each additional variable is
                  systematically incorporated into the relationships
                  that have perviously been studied. The analyses are
                  also replicative: the same relationship is studied
                  in widely varying contexts. A careful study of the
                  consequences of these procedures, both intended and
                  unintended, yields valuable insights into current
                  problems of theoretically oriented empirical
                  research.},
