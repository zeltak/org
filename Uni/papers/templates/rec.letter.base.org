To Whom It May Concern:

I write in enthusiastic support for the post-doctoral application of Liuhua Shi.
I believe Miss Shi well meets the criteria for this fellowship. I consider Miss Shi a most
promising researcher in environmental health. Her recent publications in Nature Climate
Change and Environmental Health Perspectives speak for itself. She has played a key role
as the primary data analyst in many air pollution and climate change projects that we
cooperated.

But it is the breath of expertise that Miss Shi really shines. She has a resource and
environmental science background, skills in geographical tools, as well as statistical and
epidemiological methodologies, all to complement her knowledge in environmental
health. She understands what air pollution and climate change is, what the heath measures
mean, what the public policy decision implications are, and how to effectively present the
findings and tell stories. This is a formidable package.

Recently, she has taken the lead in several exposure modeling projects. For example, she
has just finished a temperature modeling project in southeastern USA, predicting daily air
temperature using land surface temperature from MODIS at a 1 × 1 km spatial resolution.

She is redoing a previous PM2.5 modeling project in northeastern USA under my
supervision with great success. She is also about to predict daily PM2.5 concentration
using MODIS MAIAC AOD at a 1 × 1 km spatial resolution across USA, using a new
approach developed by herself. In all of these projects, she is the one doing the bulk of the
work. 

I have high expectations for her future work, and fully support her fellowship
application
