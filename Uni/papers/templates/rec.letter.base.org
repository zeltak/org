To Whom It May Concern:

_Recommendation letter on behalf of_

I write in enthusiastic support for the scholarship application of Liuhua Shi.

I believe Miss Shi well meets the criteria for this scholarship. I consider Miss Shi a most
promising researcher in environmental health. Her recent publications in Nature Climate
Change and Environmental Health Perspectives speak for itself. She has played a key role
as the primary data analyst in many air pollution and climate change projects that we
cooperated.
