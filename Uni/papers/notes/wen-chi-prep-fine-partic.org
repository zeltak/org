Dear authors, 

Enclosed please find the abstract that we will submit to the conference of International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) this year. Basically we found one CpG site in iNOS gene is significantly associate with PM exposure. We also did a epigenome-wide scanning and found 2 CpG sites pop up as well (one is CDC10L and the other one is not annotated). 

The deadline for abstract submission is next Tue. Please feel free to let me know if you have any comments, and I'll greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much and wish you have a nice weekend!
